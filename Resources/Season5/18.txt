Where'd this little guy come from?

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,198
Doug found him
in some dead guy's colon.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,366
Ugh!

4

- Hey, little guy.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,612
Doug's still pretty upset
about the whole thing.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,615
Why would he live in there?

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,244
Diseased rodents shouldn't be
nowhere near my pregnant princess.

8

<i>[J.D.] Carla being pregnant</i>
<i>changed everyone.</i>

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,321
<i>It made Dr. Kelso softer.</i>

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:30,352
Oh, I think the children in Pediatrics
would love this little fella.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>[J.D.] Carla's pregnancy</i>
<i>also affected Elliot.</i>

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,060
OK, so we're both off in a few minutes.
Here's what's gonna happen.

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,571
- We're heading back to my place.
- Oh, yeah?

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm gonna put on something
very naughty.

15
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:42,875
Awesome.

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,673
We'll have sex and pretend we
aren't using protection to make a baby.

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,907
- Un-awesome.
- Keith, we're doing this.

18
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,107
I need it.

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,812
<i>[J.D.] As for me,</i>
<i>I bought a custom-made Italian suit.</i>

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,954
Huh? What do you think?
I had it made for the christening.

21
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,155
That little mixed-race embryo
got a godfather yet?

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,791
J.D., that's something
we have to discuss as a couple.

23
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,293
You know what?
I'm not sure that suit works on you.

24
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,135
Thanks for your opinion, Carla.

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,836
But I'm much more interested
in what you all think.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,881
- We don't love it.
- Well, who cares, Lonnie?

27
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:27,112
Because all that really matters
is whether or not America loves it.

For the last time, it's Americo.

29

40

- I'll need three girls.
- Herbie, it's not a bathhouse.

41

Since Sweaty Teddy here backs up

of medicine,

49

one of you will help go through claims,
decipher medical stuff

into his tiny peanut brain.

51
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,657
How many times did I insult you
during that? I was shooting for five.

52
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,826
Only three, unless you count
"Sweaty Teddy" as an insult.

53

But my mom calls me that,
and she loves me, right?

54
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,302
No, Ted. She hates you. Four.

55
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:59,141
Since Ted has no life, and that's five,
I'll let him select his very own victim.

Ted.

57

- Oh, God.

75
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,208
I had to blow out of town.
Mom doinked her new boyfriend

00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,243
and guilted him into getting me
an interview. [shudders]

77
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,677
Well, Mom does what she has to do.

78
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,716
Why do I need a full-time job?
I got a sweet setup at home.

79
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,742
I got a sweet pad in Mom's attic,
driving Dad's old Plymouth Horizon,

80
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,187

I'm the senior bartender at KJ's,

00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,158
I take home half the extra
chicken wings. Thank you.

Dan,

83
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,526
do you ever have to pinch yourself to
make sure it's all not some crazy dream?

84
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,863
That does not count
as a formal hello, Coxsmith.

85
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,495
- Don't call him Coxsmith.
- I call him Coxsmith.

- Carla's pregnant.

I get to pick the name.

- If it's a boy, you pick the name.
- OK.

I like Angie for a girl.

96

And if it's a boy, say hello to Fu-Kwon.
What's up!

97
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,398
Maybe we should pick the names together.

98
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,807
OK. 'Cause I was thinking,
you know, for a girl...

99
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,142
Sweetie, we already have
the girl's name.

100
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,307
Now, for the boy,
why not name him after your cousin?

Tiger?

102
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,381
I'm begging you to stop telling
people that. No one believes you.

Well, tell that to the last two women

00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,010
And that is the father of my fake baby.

167
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,113
- Honey.
- Ugh. I gotta go to Jack's preschool.

168
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,746
Apparently, Seymour was teasing him,
so he punched him in the face.

169
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,621
- Do Seymour's parents have to go?
- I doubt it. They're turtles.

170
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,920
Count yourself lucky.

171
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,053
My son sent me a picture of himself

172
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,859
sitting on the lap
of his new boyfriend, Winston.

173
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,263
[Both] Oh!

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,302
Why are they dressed up
as Tonto and the Lone Ranger?

175
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:01,533
I'd like to say they're going to a
costume party, but those are jammies.

176
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,906
Look at the bright side.
He's like the daughter you never had,

177
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,343
only gay and unsuccessful.

178
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,347
- [Both laugh]
- Tell me about it.

179
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,545
So funny, the way kids are, isn't it?

180
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,349
You never know how it's gonna go.

181
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,982
<i>[J.D.] Now that Dan knew Elliot</i>
<i>wasn't into him,</i>

182
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,821
<i>my focus had shifted</i>
<i>from keeping him away from her</i>

183
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,658
<i>to avoiding him so he doesn't kill me.</i>

184
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,397
Hey, Mr. Brooks.
Let's get these bandages off you, huh?

185
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,395
What are you doing?

186
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,634
Mr. Brooks wanted safety tips
on operating propane heaters.

187
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,437
As long as you're not my brother.

188
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,843
I had a brother once.
Well, he's still my brother.

189
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,438
My parents adopted him
when I was about 12.

190
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,679
He was about 46.
Actually older than my parents.

191
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
His name was Clete and he
talked like this, "How's it going?"

192
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,519
Good kid. Did what they said.

193
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,719
Make the bed, mop the floor,
sweep the lawn, whatever.

194
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,629
Everything was good till his 50s
and, wow, did he have a midlife crisis.

195
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,795
Him and my dad fought constantly.
I mean physically beating on each other.

196
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,361
But I don't blame him for it.
I blame my mom for sleeping with him.

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,704
- That's just out of line.
- Yeah.

198
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,539
[Janitor] The reason
I'm telling you this is your brother

199
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,614
told me if I keep you focused on me,
he would let me watch.

200
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,682
Watch what?

201
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,752
- Hey, little brother.
- Ahh!

202
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,415
I can't believe they're playing
with that butt hamster.

203
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,756
That is disgusting.

204
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,353
It's my turn to hold Angie.

205
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,926
What did she call that thing?

206
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,333
- Uh, baby, we should go.
- Uh...

207
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,568
Where'd you come up with that name?

208
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,401
I guess I could help you name her.
Let's see.

209
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,344
It's a girl hamster.
What about Angie?

210
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,677
- I love it!
- Me too. Angie, guys?

211
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,309
- [All] Yeah!
- Angie, it is!

212
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,618
[Laughing]

213
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,620
- Hold his arms.
- Wait! Turk, it was an accident, OK?

214
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,254
- The name just popped into my head!
- Shut up! You just shut up right now!

215
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,259
Pink belly.

216
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,300
No! Turk!

217
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,861
<i>[J.D.] Unfortunately, Turk was the</i>
<i>greatest pink-bellier in all the land.</i>

218
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,838
[Screaming]

219
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,037
You know, Bobbo,
I find you less repugnant as of late.

220
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,841
I'm developing a begrudging
indifference to you.

221
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,280
You're so edgy and cantankerous.

222
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,080
You're like <i>House</i> without the limp.

223
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,620
I've decided this project is
over the head of that pretty lady,

224
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,853
so Dr. Cox will be replacing her.

225
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,519
That was the longest three hours
of my life.

226
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,154
[Ted] Call me.

227
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,259
Tell you what she's not good at.
Staring contests.

228
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,705
- Why, Bob?
- Why the hell not?

229
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,743
So how are you doing with your diet?

230
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,178
The best I can do, man.
How's your tummy?

231
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,775
Turk was so proud of his handiwork
that he signed it.

232
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,221
He knows it's so painful I won't
be able to wash it for some time.

233
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,258
- I mean, are you all two OK?
<i>- [J.D.] Actually, we were.</i>

234
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,385
<i>The way the whole</i>
<i>brother thing works,</i>

235
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>now that Dan had beaten me up,</i>
<i>it was all over.</i>

236
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,965
- Why'd you lie to me about Elliot?
<i>- [J.D.] Or not.</i>

237
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,058
Oh, come on, man.

238
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:20,265
A girl like Elliot could never
really be into somebody like you.

239
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,198
- Why wouldn't she?
<i>- [J.D.] The obvious response</i>

240
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,369
<i>was Elliot was looking for a guy</i>
<i>with more going on in life.</i>

241
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,710
<i>And the only way to gently break that</i>
<i>to my brother was this:</i>

242
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:34,242
Elliot wants to have kids right now
and she knows you're not ready.

243
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,055
Oh!

244
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,314
Bummer.

245
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,893
Don't worry about it, man.
He bought it. It's cool.

246
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,671
<i>[J.D.] I have to talk to Elliot</i>
<i>before my brother Dan does.</i>

247
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,371
Your back pain
may involve your spinal cord,

248
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,443
so we need to get you an MRI.
Now where is my pen?

249
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,671
[J.D.] Elliot! Elliot!

250
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,408
What's up, J.D.?

251
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,916
My brother's on his way up.

252
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:10,081
The only reason you don't wanna be with
him is 'cause he doesn't want kids now.

253
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,057
J.D., just tell him the truth.

254
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,353
Last time I was honest with Dan
about his life,

255
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,861
it made him feel like crap.

256
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,422
We didn't talk until our dad died.
Do you really want me to do that?

257
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,866
I'm not sure what would
get us back together.

258
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,597
Dad can't die again.

259
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,830
What's going on, guys?

260
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,342
I'm not having a staring contest
with you, Ted.

261
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,114
OK, one-nothing, me. Oh, yeah.

262
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,623
Yeah.

263
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,386
OK, back to work.

264
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,555
This next patient claims their stent
was implanted incorrectly.

265
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,892
What's a stent?

266
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,092
A tube that holds arteries open.

267
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,725
All right.

268
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,671
And what's a Buckland?

269
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,300
That's a hairless growth
never found on women.

270
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,237
Weird.

271
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,546
It's your last name, Ted.

272
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,481
Good one.

273
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,320
- So you got the baby fever, huh?
- Yep.

274
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,950
Hopefully I'm pregnant
with Keith's child.

275
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,826
Oh, come on! I'm 25!
I haven't even been to Europe!

276
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,865
- Keith, wait!
- No!

277
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,297
I got a good feeling
about those two. Well, I'm off.

278
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,272
- All right. Say hi to Mom for me.
- Yep. Get my stuff.

279
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,206
<i>[J.D.] And like that, he was gone.</i>

280
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,372
You know what name
I've always liked for a girl?

281
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,212
Honor.

282
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,376
Turk, you know how mean boys are.

283
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,217
They'd be all like, "I got on her.
Did you get on her?"

284
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,656
Yeah, everybody got on her
'cause she's easy.

285
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,228
- That's your daughter.
- Yes, it is.

286
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,295
It's just weird.

287
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,923
Angie was perfect.
Now nothing seems as good.

288
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,596
- What you got there, sir?
- Dead hamster.

289
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,935
Angie's dead?

290
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,168
- Baby, we got our name back!
- Yeah!

291
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,370
If no one's officially called dibs...

292
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,470
Take it, freak.

293
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,773
[Janitor] What?

294
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,785
I'm making a hamster vest
for one of my squirrels.

295
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,151
What's going on?

296
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,191
I love you too, dumpling,
but I have to work late.

297
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,726
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

298
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,355
Ted's on the phone with his mom,
so we're taking a five. Why?

299
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,195
- Why is Kelso doing this to me?
- Well, you know.

300
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,759
I don't. All I remember is that
we were both making fun of our kids,

301
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,600
and then bam, he stuck me with Ted.

302
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,733
No, no. You made fun of your kid,
he made fun of his kid,

303
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,836
and then you made fun of his kid.

304
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,077
Don't you get it? You can never say
bad things about someone else's kid.

305
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,617
Ever.

306
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,682
Mom, if you can't reach that spot
with the lotion,

307
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,725
I'll get it for you
when I get home late tonight.

308
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,761
OK, kisses.

309
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,593
- You ready to get back in there?
- Yeah. Gotta vomit first.

310
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,826
OK.

311
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,698
OK, guys, let's all gather around.
Huddle up.

312
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,296
Now, you guys,
Herbert in there needs an MRI,

313
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,138
but he won't fit.
Anybody know what we should do?

314
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,801
<i>[J.D.] Nobody wanted to say it,</i>

315
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,404
<i>but sometimes when hospitals</i>
<i>have Herbert-sized patients,</i>

316
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,418
<i>they'll send them to the one place</i>
<i>that has MRI machines big enough.</i>

317
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,453
<i>The zoo.</i>

318
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,717
I know what you're all thinking,
but I'm not gonna do that.

319
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,951
It's too humiliating.

320
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,023
You're too big for our MRI machine so
we're gonna have to take you to the zoo.

321
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,502
Damn. Well, that sucks.

322
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,329
You brought this on yourself,
didn't you?

323
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,034
[Sighs] Man.

324
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,103
Why do you hate Herbert?

325
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,010
He's been in here seven times
for weight problems.

326
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,945
He's never tried to get healthier.

327
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,849
Sometimes, protecting feelings
isn't the best way.

328
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,977
Spare me the tough love speech.

329
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:06,548
You really think being mean to Herbert
will cause him to turn his life around?

330
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,788
Probably not. But as long
as I'm trying to get him to change,

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,625
then I can sleep at night.

332
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,064
When you think about your brother later,
how are you gonna sleep?

333
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,072
- Angie and George, wow.
- Hmm.

334
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,078
- You know what's weird?
- Hmm?

335
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:31,310
Now that they have names,
everything seems so real.

336
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,544
I can see George's smile.

337
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,144
And I can see Angie
having your curly hair.

338
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,554
I hope she doesn't have
my ear infections.

339
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,161
I was really sick as a baby.

340
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,923
I was a climber.

341
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,262
Our windows don't have bars.
George can fall into the alley.

342
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,164
What if George doesn't love me?

343
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,567
What if Angie stops breathing
in her sleep?

344
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,766
Why'd we have to pick names?
I hate it when things get real!

345
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,172
When I was in high school,

346
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,211
I had a shop teacher named George
who hated black people.

347
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,009
There was a prostitute
at my town mall named Angie.

348
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,380
- Those names are out.
- Yeah, they're out!

349
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,284
- And we don't need new ones.
- Not for nine months.

350
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,719
- I'm ready for bed.
- Me too.

351
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,849
Hey, Bob, you got a minute?

352
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,193
If you killed Ted, I don't wanna know.
Just make sure it's not traceable.

353
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,030
That's not why I'm here.
But it's good to know.

354
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,797
Look, uh...

355
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,907
...I wanted to apologize
for what I said about your son.

356
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:34,241
Well, he hasn't turned out
exactly as I'd planned.

357
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,013
I always imagined we'd spend his
13th birthday fly-fishing in Montana.

358
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,347
Where did you spend it?

359
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,981
On 42nd Street, camped out
for <i>Ain't Misbehavin'</i>tickets.

360
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,556
He's a good kid, though.

361
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,724
Tell me about him.

362
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,060
He is a good kid.
He's always been a good kid.

363
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,732
First time I knew we weren't on the
same page was when he took up knitting.

364
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,803
Knitting?

365
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,771
I thought he was gonna
learn how to tie knots.

366
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,603
[# Ben Folds: <i>Still Fighting It]</i>

367
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,940
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey, Johnny.

368
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,482
Just packing up.
I thought you had to work.

369
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,711
I wanted to talk to you about something.

370
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,252
Yeah, what's up?

371
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,518
Elliot doesn't want to
have babies with Keith.

372
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:23,584
Oh. Tough break for Keith.
I almost had a threesome with that guy.

373
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,027
When I said Elliot
would never be into a guy like you,

374
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,830
it's because you're
a 35-year-old bartender

375
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,272
who still lives in our mother's attic
and is showing no signs of changing.

376
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,501
I'm not saying this
to make you feel bad.

377
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:42,138
I think you have the potential to do
whatever you want to do with your life.

378
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,183
But you have to actually try.

379

<i>[J.D.] And then I got</i>
<i>the answer I expected.</i>

380
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,819
Don't you have to get back to work?

381
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,298
<i>[J.D.] Even though I knew he wasn't</i>
<i>gonna change, Elliot was right.</i>

382
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,196
<i>It's about what helps you sleep.</i>

383
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,700
Who are we kidding?

384
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,034
This is so real now,
there's no way we can sleep.

385
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,006
<i>[J.D.] Whether it's</i>
<i>a strong sense of denial...</i>

386
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,636
<i>... or the fact that you love your son.</i>

387
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,217
<i>As for me, I was just happy</i>
<i>to get some rest.</i>

[Pager beeping]

389
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,255
Hey.

390
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,130
Hey, Johnny.
You cool if I borrow this suit?

391
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,760
I figured I might wear it
to that job interview.

392
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,298
You know what, man?
You might as well just keep it.

393
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,863
Yeah, I'll keep it.

394
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,209
You... You think anyone
would ever really hire me?

395
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,042
I think you can do
whatever you want to do.

396
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,358
Take it easy, little brother.
