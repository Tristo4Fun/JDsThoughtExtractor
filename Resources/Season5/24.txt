I don't know.

333
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,693
<i>[Elliot] I can totally</i>
<i>picture J.D., too.</i>

334
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,977
[Cell phone ringing]

335
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,643
Oh, hey, Mom.

336
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,746
No, I'm just hanging out alone tonight.
I didn't have anything else to do.

337
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,587
[Knocking on door]

338
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,122
We want to give you
your stuff back.

339
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,894
We don't feel like
dealing with that right now.

340
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,094
- How about now?
- Oh.

341
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,963
Come on in.

342
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,438
<i>Ugh. I hate cleaning up</i>
<i>after those messy old queens.</i>

343
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,483
<i>Ooh, appletini?</i>

344
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,314
<i>When did they start</i>
<i>drinking straight guy drinks?</i>

345
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,877
<i>Mmm. It's fresh.</i>

346
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,117
[Kim] What's up, chicken butt?

347
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,989
Hey, Kim. What happened
to Neil Diamond?

348
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,188
I haven't seen Keith in a while,
I'm gonna take him.

349
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,993
Kim's letting me off the hook.

350
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,590
Thank you.

351
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,362
You're welcome.

352
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,237
- What's up?
- Nothing.

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,415
<i>It seems like good friends</i>
<i>always come through for you</i>

354
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,383
- You like?
- Oh, well.

355
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,820
You know, I could,
I could wear them out to dinner.

356
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,085
- With a sports jacket?
- No.

357
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,661
It's OK. Don't get up.
I got it. [groans]

358
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,062
- OK.
- It's only your child.

359
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,467
Look, I feel like I can
give you a list of things

360
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,164
that are sucky about being pregnant.
For starters,

361
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,605
I'm now horny as I've ever been
and my husband is repulsed by me.

362
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,078
Listen, if you really need it
that badly, I will suck it up

363
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,807
and shut my eyes so tight
and then do you.

364
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,850
- Thank you for the sacrifice.
- It's because I love you.

365
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,714
My point is,

366
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,185
even with all the crap,
I'm sure it's worth it.

367
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,656
I've seen how happy
having Jack has made you two.

368
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,590
And yeah, I know it's been hard,

369
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,789
but I know that neither one of you
regret any of it.

370
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,195
[Rattling]

371
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,858
What the hell is this thing?

372
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,426
That's Jack's mobile.
Actually, it's his third mobile.

373
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,871
The first two were
embedded in the dry-wall.

374
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,238
They can be quite frustrating
to assemble.

375
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,043
Do you remember when he was teething?
He'd stare up at that thing for hours.

376
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,647
Yep.

377
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,885
Why's your TV smell like do-do?

378
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,986
So, what do you want to do tonight?

379
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,993
Just hang here and look at the stars

380
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,795
until we're comfortable enough
to make out a little.

381
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,961
OK. I'm cool with that.

382
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,473
[# Neil Diamond: <i>Delirious Love</i>]

383
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,600
- Not yet.
- Let me know.

384
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,677
<i>And like that, I felt like all was</i>
<i>right with the couples in the world.</i>

385
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,084
[Hissing]

386
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,870
OK, now.

387
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,050
<i>And right then, I knew this was the</i>
<i>start of something important.</i>

388
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,455
[Knocking on door]

389
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,564
Two and a half weeks is too long
to wait for a third date.

390
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,001
I'm pregnant.

391
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,766
What now?
