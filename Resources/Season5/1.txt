Because if there had been,

you would still hear the sound of my

110

of making you five man cards.

Hold them very dear, because every time
you drop the ball, man-wise,

166
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:56,729
her breasts can be "healthy" or
"unhealthy," never "bangin' double-Ds."

167
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,269
There's so much paperwork.

168
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,101
My dad was a veterinarian,
and he never had to do any.

169
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,472
Sometimes I wish this place
were more like a horse hospital.

170
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,984
I'm sorry, Mr. Larson,
but I do not like the look of that leg.

All right, gang, get out of here.

00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,456
Hey, everybody? Great work today.

175
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,863
How do you bother someone without being
around them? That is the question.

Dorian, I'm paying you to work, not
stand around acting like the Fonz.

179
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,952
Perfect.

180
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,053

182
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,661
Turk? I'm leaving for work.

Don't forget to use the Glade!

188
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,014
Dude! That's the best it's ever sounded!

189
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,110
- I thought she was gone?
- Nah, she came back for a quickie.

190
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,020
All this baby stuff,
I feel like she rushed me into it.

191

I'm not sure I'm ready.

192
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,324

for a week.

Dr. Reid? Need some help?

200

I don't need anyone's help.

where the Foley caths are?

203
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,325
Sir, I know where everything is.

204

Don't sweat it. I used to hide here

I'm on a fellowship now.
Foley cath, please.

Thanks.

210
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,198
Thanks. Could you also grab
a number six needle?

Hey, Keith! I just called upstairs
to see how Mr. Kellerman was doing.

217
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,684
Get this: The nurse told me you
never even started him on a Lasix drip.

218
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,229
Lisa! Imagine my surprise when
she told me you never even increased

219

his diuretic in the first place!
I'm forced to ask,

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,694
are you people trained killers?
Say something, Keith!

221
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,929
[Keith stuttering] I... uh...

222
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,407
If he gets bad enough
and we have to put him on inotropes,

223
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,004
he'll jump to the top of the
transplant list and get a new heart.

<i>There's a lot of ways to get caught.</i>

227
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,950
<i>Sometimes you get caught because</i>
<i>you couldn't slip your wife her pill,</i>

228
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,187

<i>of your special homemade brownies.</i>

229

- What's that?
- Oh, that?

230
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,664
That's a tiny marshmallow
with writing on it.

236
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,221

<i>because he made the classic mistake</i>

<i>of returning to the scene of the crime.</i>
<i>And all because I, too,</i>

238

<i>had been eating Turk's</i>
<i>homemade brownies.</i>

239

just told me that your urinalysis

came back positive
for the birth control pill.

241

- Keith, look at me.
- [Keith stammering]

What the hell.

246
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,819
I was doing this
and mouthing "I'll kill you,"

247
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,329
which I will if you don't
get out of here. Go on, get.

Long day.

251
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,502
Newbie, I did tell them to ignore you
and let Mr. Kellerman get worse.

252
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,513
And you wanna know something?
I'd do it again.

253
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,313
- Bye, Elliot.
- Look...

254
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,786
I know I agreed to have a baby,
but you were offering sex at the time.

255
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,380
- I would have agreed to anything!
- [Grunting]

Carla, no.

257
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:28,260
No! She knows I can't eat
without my strawberry milk.

258
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,925
You should've let her fork me!

259
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,268
I think that's how you got into trouble
in the first place! What's up!

260
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,308
Euphemism five!

261

262
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,703
- Elliot, why are you here?
- Oh, I have to make Kelso think

263
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,113
I work here so he doesn't have me
arrested for stealing supplies.

264
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,449
What would you have done
if you couldn't give Carla the pill?

265
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,080
- I'd have faked it.
- Guys can't fake it.

266
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,158
Really? Does this sound familiar?

"Oh, baby, we're going all night.
No, wait, don't move!

268
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,792
- Sorry."
- Way too familiar.

- Hey.
- Thank you.

270
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,869

271
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,304
Besides listening
to my Alanis Morissette CD

272
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,466
to get pumped up
to talk to you? Here.

273
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,271
- Yep.
- I've been thinking about

274
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,643
how you would take
Mr. Kellerman's life into your hands

275
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,239
- without talking to him.
- Well, I did talk to him.

276
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,579
He did.

277
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:23,349
Patients who stay low on the heart
transplant list die waiting for one.

278
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,583
This way, he moves up to the top.
Come on!

279
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,149
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- Because you're an attending now.

280
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,391
That doesn't just mean
a fat bank account, expensive new toys

281
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,331
and a lawyer on retainer
for when you kill a prostitute.

282
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,767
From now on,
the buck stops with you.

283
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,839
I know you have occasionally
bent the rules in this dump

284
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,500
over the last couple of years
because you knew

285
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,738
when the crap started raining,
it was gonna fall on my head.

286
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,781
But now, the only way for you
to stay out of the trouble storm

287
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,045
is for you to go by the book.
And I got news for you on that front:

288
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,382
By-the-book attendings kill us up here.

289
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,514
I couldn't tell you about Kellerman
'cause I don't know

290
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,683
what type of attending you're gonna be.

291
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,990
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to prove myself.

292
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,692
You know what? This is my last one.
Here, take it.

293
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,031
Whatever happens
to this poor guy is on you.

00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,669
<i>Elliot had dropped by</i>
<i>to help not talk to Turk</i>

297
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,681
<i>and I was sneaking out in my undies</i>

298
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,876
<i>because my clothes</i>
<i>were in the dryer.</i>

299
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,078
- J.D.?
- Morning, friends!

300
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,677
Who's ready for some java?

301
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,815
- Are you wearing boxers?
- Yes, I am, Carla,

302
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,327
because I know when Turk's sad,
he likes me to come over in my boxers,

303
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:41,094
because he likes to call me his "honky
Adonis." And that's what friends do.

304
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,464
<i>They bought it? Are we that gay?</i>

305
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,026
- What's that?
- Oh, that's my new driving sock.

306
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,265
You can borrow.

307
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,705
Actually, J.D.'s been
living here secretly.

308
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,835
- Turk, why?
- Get those judgmental eyes off me!

309
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,845
J.D. Didn't want to, I begged.

310
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,676
- Is that true?
- I didn't say that.

311
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,183
- J.D. Can do my voice.
- Hey, it's getting good!

312
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,219
Well, thank you! I lost it.

313
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,720
You three are ridiculous.

314
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,620
I'm just here
to grab a ride to work.

315
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,751
At a hospital where you
don't actually work! And you?

316
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,194
How am I to tell you I'm not ready
to have a baby when you're excited?

317
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,993
And you secretly moving back in here?

318
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,161
Now, I really don't love
being den mother to you three...

319
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,733
It's like crack to me.

320
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,470
Still, let me ask you something. Why
are you three so afraid of moving on?

321
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,780
You're still eating those brownies!

322
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,873
I don't wanna get pregnant!
Shoot.

323
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,047
So you're going to the university
for a transplant!

324
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,487
Well, come back and see us, OK?

325
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,286
Who is responsible
for not treating that man?

326
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,296
Well, I was going to treat him,
but I lost my stethoscope, and that's...

327
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,992
He's my patient, Bob!

328
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,796
I'm responsible.

329
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,927
Dr. Dorian, I have kept my mouth shut

330
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,495
about the recent
sexual harassment complaints

331
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,304
because I don't think it's fair
to punish a man for making small talk,

332
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:03,212
or, say, asking his secretary
just once to dress up as a geisha girl

333
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,614
- and call him Kelso-san...
- What?

334
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,914
Nothing. But now I need to know,

335
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,511
is this the type of attending
you're going to be?

336
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,116
- I guess so.
- Anything else?

337
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,685
<i>I could tell him there's nothing in my</i>
<i>cup and I'm pretending to drink</i>

338
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,663
<i>to seem nonchalant...</i>
No.

339
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,189
<i>... but I was thinking</i>
<i>about what Carla said about moving on.</i>

340
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,031
<i>And I wasn't the only one.</i>

341
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,631
Well, at least there's one attending
around here I can count on.

342
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,074
The hell with it, Bob.
I don't work here! Have a good one.

343
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,340
- I hate this place.
- It hates you, Bob.

344
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,251
That's it.
All my birth control pills are gone.

345
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,790
Not exactly. That Fig Newton
you're about to eat

346
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,123
is not only fat-free,
but it's baby-free.

347
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,559
I just don't get it, Turk.

348
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,189
Look, we had sex 20 times
in eight days,

349
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,789
and I bet it's because
you sensed my hesitance.

350
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,736
- I just want a baby so badly.
- Why?

351
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,273
What's it gonna be like having a baby?

352
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,471
Dr. Cox says it's like having a dog
that slowly learns how to talk.

353
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,206
Awesome!

354
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,239
Right? And I come from a big family,
and I love that.

355
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,818
Me too!

356
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:18,016
And every time we sit at the kitchen
table, I feel like someone's missing.

357
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,849
I can see him.

358
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,392
- J.D.!
- Gotta make a quick twosie.

359
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,467
This explains a lot.

360
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,242
Hey! Meet your volleyball team.
They're terrible.

361
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,215
Newbie! I heard your voice.

362
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,050
Thanks for nothin', ass-face.

363
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:59,154
I'm gonna go ahead and give you back one
of these man cards. You deserve it.

364
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,392
Wow. Wanna hug?

365
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,764
You held on to it as long as you could.

366
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,894
I'm gonna have a good year,
aren't I?

367
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,336
Anything can happen.

368
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,202
<i>And I knew he was right...</i>

369
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,401
- [Janitor] Excuse me.
- [Screams]

370
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,938
<i>... for all of us.</i>

371
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,742

373
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,651
Dr. Reid, are you joining us
for lunch today?

374
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,549
Anyone want half
a tofu-cheese sandwich?

375
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:34,094
Repeat after me:
Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.

376
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,929
Boy, boy, boy, very tall boy.

377
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,366
- Boy, boy...
- Boy, boy...

378
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,596
...very tall boy.
...very tall boy.

379
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,006
Good night, Keith.

380
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,841
Hey, keep your head up,
you're doing a good job.

381
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,347
[Keith] Thanks for everything,
Dr. Dorian.

382
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,723
Who am I?

383
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,456
