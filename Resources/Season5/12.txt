00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,403
<i>[J.D.] The worst thing about Elliot</i>
<i>having picked intern, Keith,</i>

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,442
<i>as her permanent booty call</i>
<i>is that if he's had a few beers,</i>

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,238
<i>he sometimes forgets</i>
<i>which bedroom is hers.</i>

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,007
Mmm...

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,846
- I'm here, lover.
- Tender.

6
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,918
In my defense, Keith's a decent kisser,

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,448
and anyone waking up that way
would let out a pleasure moan.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,222
Same thing happened in college.

9
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,458
What guy drunkenly kissed you
while you were sleeping?

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,695
<i>[J.D.] It was that moment</i>
<i>Turk and I remembered the incident</i>

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,033
<i>we'd managed to block out for 12 years.</i>

12
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,662
You OK with us not hanging out?

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,105
- Totally.
- OK.

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,804
<i>I was gonna miss Turk, but my favorite</i>
<i>intern was around to cheer me up:</i>

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,815
<i>Jason Cabbaggio. Or, as I had</i>
<i>brilliantly nicknamed him...</i>

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,249
- Cabbage!
- Yes, sir.

17
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,082
Oh, no, Mark.
I was talking to Cabbage.

18
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,213
Well, my last name is Cabbage.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,349
I know,
but I nicknamed you "Wolfman"

20
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,327
because of your keen sense of smell.

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,364
<i>[J.D.] And your</i>
<i>ridiculously hairy torso.</i>

22
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,625
What can I do you for?

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,463
Dr. D, is the IV
supposed to leak like this?

24
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,300
Well, yes and no. Mostly no.
Really, really, all no.

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,967
Don't worry. I got your back. First
thing is, take a little nipper yourself.

26
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,501
Got some on you! Look out! That's
some of the fun that you can have.

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,481
But seriously, just watch and learn,
watch and learn.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,313
It's an honor to watch you work.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,387
Take it all in, Cabbage. Take it all in.

30
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,150
<i>[J.D.] Yes, I like some interns</i>
<i>more than others,</i>

31
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,092
<i>but I never let personal feelings</i>
<i>affect my professional behavior.</i>

32
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,688
You're late, which doesn't surprise me
because you're a bad person.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,995
They needed help
with a shooting victim.

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,035
Lies will get you nowhere, Keith.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,561
- I'm covered in his blood.
- That could be anyone's blood.

36
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,573
Here's the gunshot victim.

37
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,201
Hey, look, my blood.

38
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,245
- That's not your blood.
- Yes, it is.

39
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,042
Quiet time.

40
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,146
All right, listen. If Mr. Burton
wants surgery, call me on my cellie.

41
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,053
Cool. What's your number?

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,854
- You have my number.
- I don't. I changed phones.

43
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,690
You didn't switch out old numbers
into the new phone?

44
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,459
Yeah, but I decided to just put
a couple emergency numbers on here.

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,795
The Butterball Turkey Helpline?

46
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,197
This one just says,
"That Guy In The Restaurant."

47
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,037
Hey, I clicked
with "That Guy In The Restaurant," OK?

48
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,545
We spent all night
talking about... something, OK?

49
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,513
If I need you,
I can just call Carla.

50
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,446
It's not like the two of us hang out.

51
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,645
I bet you don't have
my number in your cell.

52
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,292
<i>[J.D.] Not even Keith could bum me out,</i>

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,194
<i>because everybody's favorite patient,</i>
<i>Mrs. Wilk, is going home today.</i>

54
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,993
I'm sure not gonna miss this food.

55
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,295
Well, the nurses and I got you this.

56
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,529
- Oh! Aw...
- Huh?

57
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,606
You should see the size
of the stationery store.

58
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,975
<i>[J.D.] That was a huge courtesy laugh</i>

59
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:01,207
<i>because I was about to trump Carla's</i>
<i>goodbye gift like nobody's business.</i>

60
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,982
Mrs. Wilk, I remember
how much you like basketball,

61
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,010
so I got you a DVD of the
NBA's <i>Greatest Centers of All Time</i>

62
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,215
signed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

63
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,782
Oh, J.D., this is so sweet!

64
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,828
<i>[J.D.] Winner!</i>

65
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,194
- My gift is in the same vein.
- Oh, is it, Keith?

66
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,757
Mr. Abdul-Jabbar
is on my dad's flag football team.

67
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,303
- Hi, Patricia.
- Oh!

68
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,465
That's not my signature.

69
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,805
Did you sign this? It's illegal.

70
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:36,247
OK. Back to the psych ward,
Mr. Rosenberg. Crazy.

71
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,951
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

72
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,387
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

73
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,795
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

74
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,230
<i>[J.D.] That morning</i>
<i>seemed like any other.</i>

75
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,997
<i>Dr. Mickhead was back, having beaten</i>
<i>the rap on murdering his spouse...</i>

76
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,403
Anybody want a cool prison jumpsuit?

77
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,605
<i>Dr. Kelso was having</i>
<i>his daily staring contest</i>

78
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,114
<i>with the last</i>
<i>double-chocolate-chocolate-chip muffin.</i>

79
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,616
Let's end this charade.

80
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,983
You win again. You always do.

81
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,458
- Mmm...
- [squawking]

82
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:30,066
Would someone explain
what that bird is doing in my hospital?

83
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,105
Sanchez appears to be flying, sir.

84
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,767
I've named him Sanchez.
He set up shop in that old wreath there.

85
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,506
I'd take it down, but the patients
really seem to love the little guy.

86
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,142
That disease-infested scavenger
is a serious health risk.

87
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,185
No.

88
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,379
Do you know
the number one cause of death?

89
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,944
- Your breath?
- Infection.

90
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,083
And do you know how quickly
infection spreads in a hospital?

91
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,286
- Your breath?
- That doesn't make sense.

92
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,453
Don't care.

93
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,659
Look, infection can start
with a simple sneeze.

94
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,567
And then a handshake.

95
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,235
Perhaps an accidental collision.

96
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,481
Then a simple touch on the shoulder.

97
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,016
And just like that,
you have a patient in trouble.

98
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,823
Chinatown is awesome!

99
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,294
I want that bird gone.

100
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,632
Keith, I realize you'd like to be at
your grandmother's funeral on Saturday.

101
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,830
Heck, we all would.

102
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,669
You can't just take a day off
whenever you feel like it.

103
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,642
How come Cabbage got off
so he could go see <i>King Kong?</i>

104
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,045
Because Keith, Cabbage is an
ape enthusiast. Show him a little.

105
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,453
[Spitting, grunting]

106
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,590
It's like I'm at the zoo.

107
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,123
Put the thing in your mouth
when you... Yeah.

108
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,025
See ya, Mrs. Wilk.

109
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,863
I'm gonna miss you.

110
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,198
I'm gonna miss our late-night talks.

111
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,602
You can call me anytime you want,
sweetie.

112
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,836
Got your number right here
in my... phone. Sorry.

113
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,106
Don't even worry about it. It's OK.

114
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,272
- We are so not cool.
- We're not?

115
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,647
Why are you making such a big
deal out of this? It was a simple...

116
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,209
La-la-la-la-la-la...

117
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:32,254
Mr. Burton, hi!

118
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,022
In a few minutes, they'll come to get
you for aortobifem bypass surgery.

119
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,757
If there's anything
we can do for you, let us know.

120
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:45,195
Well, if I don't make it, I want you
to make sure my sons get this note.

121
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,203
- Done.
- Done.

122

<i>[Phone ringing]</i>

123
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,912
I can't believe you fell for that.

124
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,216
Why would that call have been for you?
It's my cell phone.

125
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,216
You got my "1" button?

126
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,828
Hey! Now I can't
call my buddies in Saigon.

127
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,923
Touché. What else can you do?

128
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,932
Could I borrow five bucks?
I left my wallet at home.

129
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,237
What do you need $5 for?
Abraham Lincoln...

130
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,470
Abraham Lincoln
is your president crush

131
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,378
or because Woolworths
is having a 48-hour girdle sale?

132
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,611
There, I did it for you.
Don't talk with your mouth full.

133
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,551
- All I have are hundreds.
- What are you, a prostitute?

134
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,918
I worked the streets.
I'm a prostitute?

135
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,752
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,388
Nice job, buddy.
Let's go get you that hat. Mine.

138
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,458
- Where's my change?
- A bird took it.

139
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,768
I want it back by tonight
or I'm gonna beat it out of you.

140
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,910
Why are you sitting here, Newbie?

141
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,941
I'd sit with my interns, but Keith's
over there and I can't stand him.

142
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,953
I've seen that kid. Horrible doctor.

143
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,048
I would sooner leave my medical care
in the hands of Dr. Acula.

144
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,993
Yes, I read your vampire screenplay
and as much as it pains me to say it,

145
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,692
I didn't hate it.
Here's what you do with this Keith:

146
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,599
Turn the heat up on his ass
and he'll make a mistake.

147
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,432
Then bounce him out of here.

148
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,167
What did you think
of the Transylvania sequence?

149
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,505
I wrote it on-call
and the next morning,

150
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,340
I read it, and I was like,
"What was I thinking?"

Bethany, focus.

152
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,212
I can't just pick
one of 'em out to torture.

153
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,050
Then dump on all of 'em! I'm sure they
deserve it. I mean, let's face facts.

00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,749
You are their teacher.
How competent can they be?

155
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,955
This morning,
one of 'em had trouble with an IV.

Yesterday, one made
a diagnosis off a backwards x-ray.

Last week, one confused
a suppository with a Mike and Ike.

00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,755
<i>because Mr. Burton</i>
<i>didn't make it through surgery.</i>

166
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,951
We did everything we could for your dad.

167
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,928
We are so sorry, Devin, Eric.

168
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,294
That's Devin. I'm Eric.

169
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,334
Oh, you guys must get that all the time.

170
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,494
Because all
black people look the same?

171
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,438
- Hmm.
- No! Because you're identical twins.

172
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,874
- Is she always this racist?
- Oh, there's a pattern.

173
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,411
Identical twins, Turk!

174
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:49,483
Uh-oh, Keith, it looks like
somebody's gone prematurely gray.

175
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,524
That's gonna hurt with the ladies.

176
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,320
[Carla] Wow.

177
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,827
Dr. Cox told me you
were tough on your interns.

178
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,525
I had no idea you were gonna
go all cotton ball on their asses.

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,763
I think I know how to deal with people,
Carla. Check this.

180
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,133
Cabbage! Heat test.

181
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,129
[Sizzling]

182
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,464
It's a little hot.

183
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,238
I'll add some milk. Thank you.

184
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,279
- See?
- Yeah.

185
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,508
<i>[J.D.] And now, it's goodbye, Keith.</i>

186
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,140
Interns, gather!

187
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,483
The next person who screws up
is gonna be suspended for two weeks.

188
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,424
This is a list of all of your names.
At least the ones I remember.

189
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:32,021
At the end of each day, I will either
write a smiley face or a sad face

190
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,965
next to your name.
One sad face, and you are gonzo.

191
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,403
And I want to warn you,
I write my sad faces pretty darn sad.

192
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,940
Allow me to demonstrate.
May I borrow your pen?

193
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,774
Not going to happen. I had to strangle
a nurse to get this clicky top.

194
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,939
Please. I'm in the middle
of a very threatening speech.

195
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,848
- Return this pen or die painfully.
- Thank you.

196
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,750
So, as I was saying, my sad face...

197
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,448
<i>[J.D.] Around here,</i>
<i>it's tough to hang onto things.</i>

198
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,686

<i>new friend away, you lie.</i>

199
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,522
The bird's dead, sir.

200
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,622
And if you're wondering,
Sanchez tasted like chicken. I ate him.

201
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,260
I get it. Now, just sign this order form
so I can stop talking to you.

202

204
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,135
You said our father left us a note?

205
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,909
Yep. Dr. Turk, give it to them.

206
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,350
Elliot, I gave it to you.
You have the note. You give it to them.

207
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,445
<i>[J.D.] If your credibility slips away,</i>

208
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,990
<i>you might have to excuse</i>
<i>yourself for a moment.</i>

209
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,791
Excuse us for just one minute,
Eric, Devin. Um... [clears throat]

210
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,159
I know it's in pencil,

211
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,532
but that's what a sad two-week
suspension face would look like.

212
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,970
All right? Very, very sad. Yes?

213
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,176
Who tried to give
Ms. Meadows an ACE inhibitor?

214
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,180
She's six months pregnant.
She could've lost the baby.

215
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,614
<i>[J.D.] Sometimes,</i>
<i>there's nothing you can do.</i>

216
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,186
That was me, sir. Sorry.

217
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,688
Oh, Cabbage.

218
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,123
Not you, Wolfman.

219
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,852
[Scoffs]

220
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,395
I, uh... I can't believe you're finally
getting out of this deathtrap.

221
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,199
The odds were against you.

222
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:24,299
You had a life-threatening disease,
a life-threatening doctor.

223
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,348
Anyway, it was
a pleasure treating you, and...

224
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,443
I know how hard it is for you
to say something nice, so you can go.

225
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,680
Thanks.

226
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,216
Why the grim face there, Trish?

227
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,853
You watching Kelso's afternoon
staring contest with the last brownie?

228
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,121
You bested me again,
you little chocolate bitch.

229
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,302
Nah, I'm just kind of
sad about my intern.

230
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,340
Why? You got what you wanted.
You drove Keith out of here.

231
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,875
No, I drove Cabbage out. That's Keith.

232
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,571
That's Keith?
That kid's the best intern we've got.

233
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,706
I'd like to bronze him,
turn my office into a Keith-edral

234
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,685
and convert to Keith-stianity.
And FYI, I still want my pen back.

235
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,722
- Oh, I don't have it.
- You better find it, nubile one.

236
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,918
And when you do, I want it
buffed, shined and de-nerdified.

237
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,031
[Whistles]
You think that's funny? This isn't over.

238
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,867
What's not over?

239
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,875
- Turk, I did not lose it. You did.
- I don't lose things.

240
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,040
Please, you lose everything. Sometimes
I worry what you'll be like as a dad.

241
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,644
We're on our way back right now.

242
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,346
Junior and I just went
to pick up a pumpkin.

243
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,123
I'm gonna have to call you back.

244
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,151
Look, somebody left a baby here.

245
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,132
- Well, he is kind of cute.
- Phew!

246
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,264
- Our baby's first bath.
- Oh, watch the head.

247
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,807
[Cheering]

248
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,308
What?!
Come on! That was intentional!

249
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,942
- Charge the mound, son!
- [Both] Charge the mound!

250
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,543
We are so damn proud of you, son.

251
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,146
My little valedictorian.

252
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,486
- Ah!
- [Splatting]

253
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,254
[Sobbing] Put him back together,
baby! No!

254
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,124
Mom? Dad?

255
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,736
Son? Son?

256
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,639
Get over here, boy! You come
and you give your father a hug!

257
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,370
No!

258
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,077
You all right?
You were gone for a long time.

259
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,207
You're gonna be an awful father!

260
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,718
<i>[J.D.] And now to take care of my boy.</i>

261
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,447
Cabbage is back!

262
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,751
Gang, I should've made it clear earlier.

263
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:57,262
The suspension policy begins today
at 4pm. So my apologies to Cabbage.

264
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,355
- That's OK, Dr. D.
- You get in there!

265
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,299
This is totally unfair.
If I had messed up, I'd be gone.

266
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,098
Let me explain something to you.

267
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,731
I treat each and every one of you
like unique individuals, OK?

268
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,742
Take Gloria, for example.
The woman's 400 years old.

269
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,836
She needs to sleep a lot.
I work around that schedule.

270
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,044
Wolfman's got to be home by daybreak,
so he does all his work come nightfall.

271
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:23,748
Crazy Barry, not allowed near children.
We work around that.

272
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,881
How come I don't get a nickname?

273
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,121
Not everyone's last name
lends itself to a nickname, Keith.

274
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,957
My last name is Dudemeister.

275
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,796
And what am I supposed to do with that,
OK? I'm not a magician.

276
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,604
Patricia, it's been a real pleasure
having you here at Sacred Heart,

277
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,633
and I certainly hope the next
time you fall ill, you'll remember us.

278
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,078
I'm not implying that you'll get ill,

279
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,242
it's just that you're old
and chances are good...

280
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,876
Stop talking, Robert.

281
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,812
It's all right. I know what you meant.

282
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,657
Damn it, Sanchez. I told you
Dorian's in room 136. This is...

283
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,357
[caws]

284
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,593
136. I was wrong.

285
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,966
I apologize, Sanchez.
You were right, as always.

286
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,831
What?

287
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,930
[Cox] Hey, Newbie!

288
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,272
Watch out for the bedpan.

289
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,272
Now we're even.

290
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,012
But answer me this one question,
will ya, please?

291
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,249
Those are beautiful antlers.

292
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,621
Huh? Why is that screw-up still here?

293
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,458
You see, Dr. Cox, I treat each
and every one of my interns differently.

294
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,394
And you're done.

295
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,434
So you accidentally
drummed your friend out of here

296
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,867
because you were trying
to 86 The Dudemeister?

297
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,461
That nickname will never stick.
It's too long.

298
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,872
Listen carefully, Newbie.
Things happen for a reason.

299
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,208
Think back on all those mistakes
that your interns made

300
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,713
and tell me this: Who made them?

301
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,944
Hey, Dr. D, is the IV
supposed to leak like this?

302
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,049
I'm not quite sure
what I'm looking at here.

303
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:12,229
Don't worry. You're gonna feel much
better once I insert this suppository.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,468
I don't remember
who made those mistakes.

305
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,060
Yeah, you do.

306
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,635
<i>[J.D.] OK, this sucks. But at least I</i>
<i>didn't forge a note from a dead father.</i>

307

You guys ready?

308
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,782
All right, Elliot, begin.

309
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,750
"My dearest Eric.

310
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,448
It is my wish for you
that you finally find a good woman..."

311
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,547
I'm gay.

312
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,491
"...so that she might
find you a man..."

313
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,857
Dad didn't know I was gay.

314
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,362
"...so that he might find you a woman."

315
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,264
I found your note in Sanchez's wreath.

316
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,029
Also little furniture.
Don't know where he got that.

317
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,072
Sure the hell didn't make it.
He didn't have the time.

Ours is better than that.

321
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,091
Well, it's done. I had him stuffed.

322
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,197
Terrific.

323
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,363
And he's gone.

324
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:27,929
Wow, that was impressive,
my friend. You're free to fly.

00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,891
Oh, really?

330
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,995
Ah!

331
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,797
There! Tell him I'm good.

332
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,841
Oh, he's good, Keith. Really good.

333
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,933
Thanks for the warning.

334
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,505
Hey, Dr. Dorian.

335
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,642
Hey, Jason. We need to talk.

336
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,850
Look, you're not progressing
as fast as the other interns,

337
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,892
and you've been
making a lot of mistakes lately.

338
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,952
I know what you're gonna say.
I really am suspended for two weeks.

339
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,623
But I promise I'll do much better
when I come back.

340
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,066
Yeah, about coming back...

347

Excuse me for a sec.

348
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,194
- Ahem.

349
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,238
Incoming call from Elliot Reid?

350
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,036
You're on speed dial, baby.

351
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,274
Ah!

352
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,970

357
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,699
You've always been really nice to me and
I wanted to say thanks and goodbye.

358
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,502
Oh, goodbye, young man.
