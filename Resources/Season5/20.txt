1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,200
- Todd, what are you doing?
- Waiting for my moment.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,333
<i>[J.D.] OK, moving on.</i>
<i>It was time for my new daily ritual:</i>

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,469
<i>Asking Dr. Cox to lunch.</i>

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:16,379
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Not having it with you, Paula.

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,144
Oh. Good luck eating.

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,982
This is every spoon
from the cafeteria.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,021
And guess what?

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,057
Today just happens to be
soup and frozen yogurt day.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,753
I'm gonna have tomato and strawberry.

10
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,261
[Cox] Lunch for us?
Not going to happen.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,857
Normally, I'd say something harsh now
like, "We're not friends,"

12
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,959
but you'll grin that stupid grin
and shake your head,

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,528
like, "How could that
possibly be true?"

14
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,574
Because it's ludicrous.

15
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,040
Just give me a spoon, will you please?

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,079
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- [J.D.] You've called my bluff.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,048
Today isn't soup and yogurt day.
It's actually salad and smoothie day.

18
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,483
I'm still having tomato and strawberry.

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,646
I'm having a weird pregnancy craving.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,681
Hey, J.D., if you go out,
would you get me a hot Italian sausage?

21
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,728
I got a hot Italian sausage
for you right here.

22
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,962
People think I luck into these
situations, but it's really hard work.

23
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,297
You know what else is hard?
I should go.

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,428
I think I may vomit.

25
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,466
<i>[J.D.] Some doctors like to change</i>
<i>into their streets for lunch. Not me.</i>

26
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,171
<i>I like how the world</i>
<i>reacts to me as a doctor.</i>

27
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,737
<i>Whether it's a friendly greeting</i>
<i>from the world's slowest bagger.</i>

28
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,478
- Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
- Lookin' good, pal.

29
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,112
Eggs on top. All right?
Eggs on top.

30
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,190
<i>Or a smile from the manager</i>
<i>of the herbal section.</i>

31
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,816
Hey, Rebecca.
You got that Echinacea for me?

32
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,384
Just kidding.
I think all this stuff is voodoo.

33
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,158
Good to see you. Hey!

34
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,564
Looks like somebody else
is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?

35
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,966
Oh, no. What the hell?
Did you follow me here?

36
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,403
A friend dropped me off.

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,738
Eagle!

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,206
Hey, wanna go splitsies
on some deli counter meatloaf?

39
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,309
I can't finish a whole serving.
I can, but I don't like to.

40
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:04,345
- It all goes right here.
- Could this be any more of a nightmare?

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,424
[Woman] Guys!

42
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,823
<i>Yes, it could be more of a nightmare.</i>

43
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>Jill Tracy was a former patient</i>
<i>who had once tried to kill herself.</i>

44
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,960
<i>Sad, yes,</i>

45
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:17,196
<i>but this did not change the fact</i>
<i>that she was unbelievably annoying.</i>

46
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,464
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,405
I was meeting a guy for a date.
I know you're thinking.

48
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,740
A Tuesday lunch date at the market,
he is so not into her.

49
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,746
Well, guess what? He's not.

50
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,616
I've been waiting for, like, an hour

51
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,244
thinking how many more guys
from my yoga class can totally reject me

52
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,481
without me saying, "Enough!"
You know?

53
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,922
Yogurt pretzels? Yum.
These are addictive.

54
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,459
I'll have one anyway.
Wanna grab some lunch?

55
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,622
- We have to get back to the hospital.
- Bummer.

56
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,392
Trail mix?
[Growling sound]

57
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,026
I won't. Awesome! Awesome!

58
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,263
You know what, Newbie?
Stay. Have lunch.

59
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,463
[Whizzing sound]

60
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,474
Those emergencies.
I should go too. How are things?

61
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,835
- You know that's stealing.
- Come on, Rebecca,

62
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,178
everybody's doing it.

63
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,416
I won't tell anyone if you don't.

64
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,883
- Security!
- Security?

65
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,048
We've got a grazer.

66
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,388
I don't think there's
a security force...

67
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,892
OK. Hey, fellas.

68
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,794
Wherever you're taking him,
take me too. No, you go ahead.

69
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,833
Where's the shaving cream?
Is that aisle two still?

70
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,392
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

71
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,496
# <i>No, I know I'm no Superman</i>

72
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,906
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

73
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,879
<i>Today was a busy day</i>
<i>at Sacred Heart.</i>

74
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,285
<i>We had three separate patients</i>
<i>waiting for transplants.</i>

75
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,880
<i>We were doing everything</i>
<i>we could to keep them alive</i>

76
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,482
<i>while we could locate donors.</i>

77
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,325
<i>There was Mrs. Sykes,</i>
<i>who needed a new liver.</i>

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,593
<i>There was Mr. Dennison,</i>
<i>who needed a new heart valve.</i>

79
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,762
<i>And then there was Dr. Cox's guy,</i>
<i>Dave Bradford.</i>

80
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,397
Davey Boy, I promise you,
we're gonna find you a kidney.

81
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,601
I would swear on my father's grave,

82
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,043
but whenever I go there
I end up dancing on it.

83
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,876
And so begins another round
of "Who Had the Worse Dad?"

84
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,417
One of pop's nicknames
for me was Sparky.

85
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,715
He liked to light matches off my neck.

86
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,883
We've been over this. You win on
account of your father's not dead yet.

87
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,893
<i>[J.D.] Most stress with</i>
<i>so many people clinging to life.</i>

88
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,326
<i>Dr. Cox vibed on it.</i>

89
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,523
As I lie in bed each morning
and ask myself

90
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,898
why I should put both my feet
on the floor,

91
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,132
there are precious few reasons
that I've ever come up with.

92
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,471
The chance to escape
Jordan's morning breath, sure.

93
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,567
Scotch. It's too early to drink it,
yes,

94
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,875
but it is never too early
to think about.

95
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
And, of course,
the ever-present possibility

96
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,374
that I might finally
happen upon Hugh Jackman

97
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,148
and give him the present
I've been holding for him.

98
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,189
Bam!

99
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,753
Still, the most persuasive argument
I've ever been able to come up with

100
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:59,560
is that I get to come to this hospital
every day and help keep people alive.

101
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,795
That's ironic, four people died
while you were talking.

102
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,462
We need to keep them going
until we can find donors.

103
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,200
Barbie, check on Mrs. Sykes's
ammonia level. She's encephalopathic.

104
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,642
Gandhi, review Dennison's chart
and get me a consent.

105
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,805
Bobbo, get on the horn
to your cronies at local hospitals

106
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,247
and get me a donor update.

107
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,877
Fine. Some of the boys
are coming over tonight.

108
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,150
I'll bring it up to Morrison while he
sets up the projector for stag flicks.

109
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,283
Don't need the visual
of old men with erections.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,260
And now it's in my head forever.

111
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,425
Sorry. Go step up Davey Bradford's
dialysis to take your mind off of it.

112
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,265
- Newbie, feel like a sandwich?
- I do feel like a sandwich.

113
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,033
You feel more like a pastry.
A very doughy pastry.

114
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,339
I don't feel good about that.
Way too easy.

115
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,610
<i>[J.D.] I had one objective</i>
<i>in my trip to the store.</i>

116
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,452
<i>Pick up everyone's lunch</i>
<i>and get out of Dodge.</i>

117
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,993
[Up-tempo music plays]

118
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,331
[J.D.] Whoa!

119
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,674
- J.D.?
- Hey, Jill.

120
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,973
How weird is it that we were both
here two days in a row?

121
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,607
I thought there was a 15% chance
the guy who blew me off yesterday

122
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,379
got his days wrong
and would be waiting with roses.

123
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,285
- Is that sad?
- It's not, not sad.

124
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,188
I have the day free. My shrink
couldn't make our appointment.

125
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,126
He found his wife in bed with his
second wife and downed an entire bottle

126
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,221
of his bulimic daughter's Prozac.
He's back in the hospital.

127
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,564
- That's an awesome story, Jill.
- It's true.

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,074
- Hey. What did you do last night?
- Turk made me watch <i>Anaconda.</i>

129
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,476
- Is that the one with the giant snake?
- No.

130
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,980
This is the one with the giant snake.

131
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,212
I was back here for 45 minutes
waiting for a set-up.

132
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,753
My back is killing me.
But I nailed it.

133
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,288
It's about commitment.

134
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,519
Hey. How could your intern, Lisa,
sleep with him?

135
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,856
She's a tramp with no morals.

136
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,488
I never slept with the Todd. [scoffs]

137
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,089
Lisa is sweet and people
don't give her a chance.

138
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,227
I wonder who else
Todd lied about sleeping with?

139
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,003
- I didn't sleep with him.
- God, no.

140
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,936
- Are you kidding me?
- Todd?

141
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,777
Is he the big black security guard
with the hook hand?

142
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,975
- No.
- Then no.

143
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,586
- Am I ever getting out?
- We haven't found you a kidney yet,

144
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,552
but I have some ideas.

145
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,258
Yeah, this will do.

146
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,427
Ah, what the hell.

147
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,261
I can live with one kidney.

148
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:56,104
'Cause we'll probably just...
go 'head and sell this one.

149
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,473
Stay away from my organs.

150
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,021
- What are you doing?
- Having lunch.

151
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,024
Cafeteria stinks
and I can't go to the grocery store

152
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,560
because crazy Jill Tracy lives there.

153
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,062
Every time I try and shop
she follows me around

154
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,963
like I'm her only friend
in the world. It's pathetic.

155
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,400
- Well, I'm gonna go talk to Carla.
- I'll come, too.

156
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,028
I figured.

157
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,666
Hey, why do you think Todd lies about
hooking up with all those women?

158
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,607
Maybe he's just over-compensating.

159
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,135
My brother used to brag about girls
dated right before he quit baseball

160
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,774
and started dancing
for Japanese businessmen.

161
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,112
Todd's not gay.

162
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,313
Turk, he has leather jeans
in three different colors.

163
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,322
[EIliot] Barry danced in leather jeans.

164
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,655
He'd come home
and they'd be stuffed with yen.

165
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,218
I'll tell you when I first
suspected he was gay.

166
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,526
It was very subtle, but...

167
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,635
Oh, yeah, Dale, this is totally
gonna bring out your pecs.

168
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,868
Plus I'm using olive oil
so I can lick it off later.

169
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,136
Make 'em dance!
Oh, they're dancin'!

170
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,477
Somebody's makin' them dance!
Whoo-eee. Whee!

171
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,842
- Tell them that never happened!
- It happened. I was there.

172
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,820
I think I just got the move-on signal
from a hook.

173
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,561
- [All] Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, give me the update here.

174
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,093
Bradford's electrolyte
and fluid balance are stable.

175
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,903
Mr. Dennison isn't looking so good.
He's on max inotropes and in failure.

176
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,434
Sykes is encephalopathic.
Ammonium level is through the roof.

177
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,005
- She's circling the drain.
- Let's try to keep these people alive.

178
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,641
What do you say?

179
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,151
Dr. Dorian, can you help me?

180
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,190
Sure. What's wrong?

181
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,022
She was admitted a short time ago
and hasn't regained consciousness.

182
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,461
Tox screen's positive for cocaine.

183
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,637
Do you think she could have O.D.'d?

184
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,936
She had been stood up
on a couple of dates.

185
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:14,173
And she hadn't seen her shrink
in a while.

186
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,407
She was definitely depressed.

187
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,509
- How do you know all that?
- She told me.

188
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,748
<i>[J.D.] In hospitals,</i>
<i>there are certain rules.</i>

189
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,017
<i>With surgeons,</i>
<i>if the over-compensating,</i>

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,992
<i>pumped-up,</i>
<i>shaved-down doctor seems gay...</i>

191
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,224
- So, man, you trying a new workout?
- No. Why?

192
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,830
Oh, he's glistening.

193
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,335
<i>... he's probably gay.</i>

194
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,931
<i>And with organ transplants,</i>
<i>if there's good news for one doctor...</i>

195
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,341
People, I've got our organs.

196
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,141
<i>It probably means</i>
<i>bad news for another.</i>

197
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,676
You can use her organs.

198
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,948
Thank you.

199
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,684
Just tell me this,

200
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,125
is there anything
anyone could have done?

201
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,298
No.

202
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,061
<i>Unless you mean me.</i>

203
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,405
<i>It's amazing how quickly people</i>
<i>improve once they get a new organ.</i>

204
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,813
<i>Whether it's Mrs. Sykes</i>
<i>with her new liver.</i>

205
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,947
<i>Mr. Dennison with his new heart valve.</i>

206
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,283
<i>Or Dave.</i>

207
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,859
How's that new kidney feel, huh?

208
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,828
A little loose, but I'll get used to it.

209
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,661
Yeah, you will.

210
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,393
Thanks for everything, man.

211
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,901
Don't sweat it.

212
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,730
All right, gather around.
Here we go.

213
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,937
Now, I'm sure we all recognize just
how rare it is to get a win like this.

214
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,344
But as we are surrounded
by patients who are clinging to life,

215
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:59,316
I'm going to give kudos
in whisper form.

216
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,014
Since I'm an egomaniac,
first props come to me.

217
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,217
- Let me hear it, people.
- You are some kind of super hero.

218
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,452
You're a god.

219
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,256
You're a beautiful healer.

220
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,889
This was not a complete
and total solo effort.

221
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,731
It was an extraordinary job
done by each and every one of you.

222
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,498
- I can't hear a word he's saying.
- Be older, Bob.

223
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,598
Just because
I can't hear your silly-ass whispering

224
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,903
doesn't mean I'm old.

225
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,207
I'm going to my office
and tinker with my new computer.

226
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,907
- What kind is it?
- It's about 3:30.

227
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,913
I heard what he said, people,
but damn, that joke's a classic.

228
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,119
And why are you not
giddy with praise like those people?

229
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,355
Don't you know I dole out compliments,
at most, once a year?

230
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,297
And like a squirrel, you must
gather up these acorns of kind words

231
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,858
to sustain you for the upcoming cold,
sarcastic months.

232
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,269
Any idiot could have seen
that Jill was in trouble.

233
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,707
I'm supposed to be a doctor.

234
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,341
I'm the reason she's dead.

235
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,902
<i>Then he said the words</i>
<i>I never expected to hear.</i>

236
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,347
Why don't you and I
go grab some lunch?

237
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,442
That'd be good. Come on.

238
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,923
Oh, my God.
He looks so sad.

239
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,464
I just want to hold him
like a big gay baby.

240
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,128
This is incredible.
An hour ago you guys hated him.

241
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,636
An hour ago he wasn't
our new gay best friend.

242
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,196
Leave the Todd alone, OK?
Because every time you two meddle,

243
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,970
you know who suffers? Me.

244
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,111
Remember when the Janitor
took that chiropractic class

245
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,080
and you guys wanted to encourage him?

246
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,412
Guys, I'm really
not comfortable with this.

247
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,922
You'll be fine. I've done this
on four mop heads. All right?

248
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,854
I haven't had a complaint yet.

249
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,053
OK. On three.

250
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,494
One... two...

251
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,191
- [cracking]
- [Screaming]

252
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,324
Better? Yes?

253
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,529
[Screaming]

254
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,775
You're fine. We're doing this.

255
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,936
Does this sound fine to you?

256
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,171
[Neck cracking]

257
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
I can fix that, buddy.
On the count of three.

258
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,610
One, two...

259
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,810
- [cracking]
- Oh!

260
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,547
- Yeah?
- No.

261
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,818
You owe me $500.

262
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,721
Excuse me? Could you spare
a few minutes for AIDS Research?

263
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,824
Yes, I can, but I'm not sure
just how much we'll get done.

264
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,266
I'll tell you what.

265
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,705
We'll go over here and brainstorm
while we wolf down these sandwiches.

266
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,638
Newbie, come.

267
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,007
<i>[J.D.] Vintage Cox.</i>

268
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,748
Know what I was thinking
while having lunch with Jill?

269
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,513
- What's that?
- God, this girl's annoying.

270
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,078
I saw her in that supermarket, too,
but I'm not torturing myself.

271
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,386
- Would you like to know why?
- Why?

272
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,689
She didn't come
to the hospital for help.

273
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,127
We bumped into her
out here in the world.

274
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,788
Don't get me wrong.

275
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,766
If a guy gets shot
or if he has a heart attack

276
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:07,135
and I am physically
the closest doctor to him,

277
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,935
I will intervene.

278
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,340
Shy of that, you can't.
I mean, you just can't.

279
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,345
- It's too much to ask yourself.
- OK. I hear you.

280
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,382
No. You don't.

281
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,476
Once you start blaming yourself
for deaths that aren't your fault,

282
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,681
my friend, that's a slippery slope
you can't come back from.

283
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,716
I've seen it ruin a lot of good doctors,
and I will not let it happen to you.

284
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,923
<i>[J.D.] And because he said that,</i>
<i>I knew it wouldn't.</i>

285
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,132
Game time. Go!

286
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,366
Todd, do you have second?

287
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,069
- I'm on my way to the gym.
- That's what it's about.

288
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,409
Whoa. Did something happen to the gym?
Don't lie to me.

289
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,812
- We know about your...
- Situation.

290
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,443
- You are hiding from yourself.
- Stop hiding, Todd.

291
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,283
- We accept you.
- No matter who you love.

292
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,913
The Todd's confused.

293
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,186
...our little baby.
You were wrong. It went great.

294
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,355
At first he was a little emotional,
but by the end of it,

295
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,663
he was saying how happy he was
that he didn't have to live a lie.

296
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,169
Then he French-braided my hair
and took it out

297
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,604
'cause he said I could not pull it off.
He is so honest.

298
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,675
It was great.

299
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,437
It was like he changed
into a whole new person.

300
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:24,039
God, how awesome is it gonna be
not having that pig wandering the halls?

301
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,777
Hey, Mickhead.

302
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,684
Is that package for me?
You know it is!

303
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,818
You ladies must be so proud.

304
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,723
- Todd, what are you doing?
- I'm getting my gay on.

305
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,126
Hey, buddy, you and I should
totally have sex sometime.

306
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,688
See? I knew this was
going to come back to me.

307
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,791
<i>[Pager beeping]</i>

308
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,205
- What's going on?
- [Turk] Everybody's failing.

309
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,369
Mrs. Sykes is indicating neuropathy.

310
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,608
My valve transplant patient
is suffering partial seizures.

311
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,608
How... how you feeling there, Dave?

312
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,985
Pretty good,
but my feet are a little numb.

313
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,322
- You hang tight, all right?
- OK.

314
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,554
I don't get it.
Doesn't make sense.

315
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,188
Perry, the autopsy just came in
on your donor Jill Tracy.

316
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,096
She didn't die of an overdose.

317
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,126
<i>[J.D.] Just like that, whatever burden</i>
<i>of responsibility I felt was lifted.</i>

318
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,537
<i>But like I said before,</i>
<i>good news for one person</i>

319
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,132
<i>can be bad news for another.</i>

320
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,734
She died of rabies?

321
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,615
OK, people, all of our
transplant patients are infected.

322
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,517
We know what we're dealing with here.
Let's get involved. We can do this.

323
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,084
Todd, you were impressive
in surgery today.

324
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,128
Thanks, man.

325
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,789
You were impressive in the shower.
You know, dong-wise.

326
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,091
- Todd.
- What?

327
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,136
Stop it.

328
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,364
The point of coming to grips
was to accept yourself

329
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,771
and stop being that guy.

330
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,138
I'm sorry.

331
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,770
This whole change is just scaring me.
I'm not sure who I am anymore.

332
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,575
- Come here.
- Get over here, sweetie.

333
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,618
- I know. Let it out.
- We're here for you.

334
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,049
Whoa!

335
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,554
- What the hell are you doing?
- Motor-boating.

336
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,547
I really gotta thank you gals
for outing me.

337
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,786
Chicks dig gay dudes.

338
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,986
Hey Lisa.

339
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,223
I heard you lied
and said we didn't do it.

340
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,889
Admit it, we doinked.

341
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,263
I was sad because my dad died.

342
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,495
I wasn't.

343
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,004
So this whole thing was an act?

344
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,202
I cannot believe that I let you in that
fitting room while I was trying on bras.

345
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,211
- Ew!
- That was a very special time for me.

346
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,247
Unbelievable.

347
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,748
He saw the girls.

348
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,841
It's cool if you want to walk away,

349
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,977
'cause I love to watch you go.

350
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,386
Nothing wrong with those.

351
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,391
<i>[Todd] Nothing wrong</i>
<i>with that either. Or that.</i>

352
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,256
<i>Or that.</i>

353
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,268
What the hell are you?

354
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,893
I'm The Todd.

<i>[J.D.] We did all we could over the days</i>
<i>to keep the patients going,</i>

356
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,742
<i>but odds were against us.</i>

357
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,914
<i>First we lost Mrs. Sykes.</i>

358
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:22,585
<i>[</i># The Fray: <i>How to Save a Life]</i>

359
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,932
<i>And then Mr. Dennison.</i>

360
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,613
<i>And I knew that Dr. Cox</i>
<i>needed me the exact same way</i>

361
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,747
<i>that I needed him earlier.</i>

362
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,053
Hey. Hungry?

363
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,684
No.

364
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,063
I guess our lunch
was kind of a one time thing, huh?

365
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,764
There's no way you could have
seen that coming.

366
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,810
I mean, rabies? Come on.

367
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,779
There's like three
reported cases a year.

368
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,975
Testing would've been irresponsible.

369
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,781
We would've wasted time
those people didn't have.

370
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,721
I was obsessed

371
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,157
with getting those organs.

372
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,818
You had to be.

373
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,796
The fact is that those people
were gonna die in hours

374
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,627
and you had to make a call.

375
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,093
I would've made the same call.

376
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,369
- Yeah?
- Yes.

377
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,943
I got us lunch,
and I think we should eat it.

378
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,277
<i>Right then, I knew</i>
<i>I was gonna pull him out of this,</i>

379
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,911
<i>But sometimes the hospital picks a day</i>
<i>where it's just gonna pile it on.</i>

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,716
<i>[Both pagers beeping]</i>

381
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,849
Oh, God. Come on.

382
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,423
Clear!

383
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,800
Still in V-tach. Clear!

384
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,532
Come on. Clear!

385
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,342
Come on, come on.

386
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,846
Come on! God!

387
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,233
He wasn't about to die,
was he, Newbie?

388
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,076
Could've waited another month
for a kidney.

389
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,882
Where are you going?
Your shift's not over. Hey!

390
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,488
Remember what you told me?

391
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,026
The second you start blaming yourself
for people's deaths...

392
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,663
...there's no coming back.

393
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,399
Yeah.

394
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,836
You're right.
