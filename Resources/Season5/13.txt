<i>Hey, a root beer.</i>

166
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,746
Don't open that soda.

167
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,345
It has been rolling on the floor.
It will explode.

168
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:21,257
Apparently, you're not familiar
with the John Dorian three-tap method.

169
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,387
Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.

170
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
Works every time.

171
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,364
Ahh!

172
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,974
The quickest way to my house
is to take Elm.

174
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,119
Elliot, wait.

175
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,556
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I looking at your dad too much?

176
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,220
His eyes penetrate my soul.

177
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,423
[Laughs] No.

178
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,833
I just want to tell you
how beautiful you look right now.

179
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,839
That is so sweet.

181
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,184
Tell you something I learned today.

182
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,688
Wet sand plus dehumidifier
equals cave-in.

183
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,884
Is that Ted and a bunch of damn bikers?

184
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,222
Why do you hate bikes so much, sir?

185
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,168
Son, Daddy's got to move on.

186
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,203
And I just want you to know

187
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,602
that since the car
is in your mother's name,

188
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:45,838
I wouldn't be able to leave the family
forever if it weren't for your bike.

189
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,553
It's complicated.

190
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,316
Get off the road!

191

192
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,160
Not today, Bobby! Not today!

193

Oh...

194
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,132
I see we're growling
at other human beings now.

195
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,640
How're you feeling, Mrs. Wilk?

196
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,271
Oh, not great. I'm cold.

197
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,474
She's been getting weaker.

198

200
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,488
That was fun.
I'm glad you got my message.

201

I didn't get any message.

202

- Oh.
- Elliot, if he didn't get your message,

203
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,228
that means he called you for sex
and you went over and gave it to him.

204
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,700
You're his booty call now.

205

207
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,308
Don't worry, Teddy. He'll turn.

208
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,507
Why'd you leave me, Daddy?!

209
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,348
Whoa!

210
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,486
Now we got leverage.

211
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,493
<i>[J.D.] Unfortunately, as a doctor,</i>

212
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,125
<i>you see your fair share of people</i>

213
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,998
She's in multi-organ
systems dysfunction.

214
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,030
She's OK. She's ready.

215

<i>[J.D.] Mrs. Wilk didn't have much time,</i>

216

Phew!

220

Pretty strong there, Newbie.

221
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,398
<i>[J.D.] I was not.</i>

222
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,434
<i>But hopefully, the duct tape I used</i>
<i>to connect my prosthetic arms was.</i>

223
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,037
Ah!

224
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,243
Ow.

225
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:11,555
Why are we doing this? I've seen people
in Mrs. Wilk's shape turn around.

226
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,387
She could totally turn it around.

227
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,949
Denial.

228
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,087
Yeah, it's not uncommon
for people close to the patient

229
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,428
to also go through
the five stages of grief.

230
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,161
- It's not denial. She could rally.
- Totally rally.

231
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,569
Oh, yeah. I mean, look at her.
She should be in a vitamin commercial.

232
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,200
How would you like to be
in a broken jaw commercial?

233

God help me, I don't care
if it does give me cancer,

00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,375
I just love this fake sugar.

If he keeps ignoring my threats,
I'm gonna have to hit him.

236
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,313
The good news is,
it looks like he has a soft face.

237
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,719
- [Man] Are you done with my arms?
- Coming to ya, Mr. Johnson.

238
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,900
So I was Keith's booty call,
whatever. It'll blow over.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,230
That's not good enough, Elliot.

240
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:02,138
By letting Keith get the upper hand,
you've given Turk ideas. Look at him.

241
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,670
Baby, I know you hate
my cool walking stick,

242
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,307
but I got to be my own man.

243
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,252
It's catching on. Yeah.

244
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,723
OK, Teddy.
I got this baby flowing now.

245
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,728
I don't know if that's good.

246
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,823
You should sue Kelso.
You have a serious tort on your hands.

247
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,026
Tort?

248
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,467
Civil case. From the French <i>avoir tort.</i>

249
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,095
Did you go to law school?

250
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,174
No. I was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
janitor for a while.

251
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,611
- Ruth Bader who?
- Hey! There's my guy.

252
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,945
Listen, I just came up to apologize
for that little fender-bender out there.

Absolutely!

more than that, I'm afraid.

Well, you know,
this isn't about you, Keith.

289

This is about men everywhere who
have been abused and bullied by women.

290
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,440
It's about me.

291
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,237
Now when they walk by,
you call her a different name.

292
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,573
I won't do it.

293
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,512

from Keith: Ignore him.

- Yep.

No, I would never call you...

OK, I know how you can
regain control of Keith.

Don't bother.
That booty call thing was fun,

of being a cold, emotionless bastard.

Don't ever get sick and tired

- No!

reminded of no-strings-attached fun.

<i>someone died, but this felt different.</i>

332
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,883
[Flatline tone]

333
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,356
She's gone.

334
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,765
[# Pearl Jam with Neil Young:
<i>Long Road]</i>

335
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,737
<i>[J.D.] We were definitely</i>
<i>in the depression stage.</i>

336
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,239
<i>And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it.</i>

337
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,242
<i>All he said was...</i>

338
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,643
She was lucky
to have you two as doctors.

339
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,576
<i>[J.D.] Letting go is never easy.</i>

340
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,186
<i>Whether it's letting go of</i>
<i>the leverage you had over your boss...</i>

341
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,192
I would like the word
"maintenance" on my uni written out

342
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,888
in tiny light bulbs.
That way, when I'm on a break,

343
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,726
I can turn it off like a taxi.

344
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,958
Your friend settled. It's over.

345
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:07,370
I got seven Sunday afternoons
off a year. Yay!

346
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,835
<i>... or letting go of your old booty call</i>
<i>and making him your boyfriend.</i>

347
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,469
Hey.

348
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,107
Do you want to go for dinner tonight?
And I mean at seven, not midnight.

349
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,481
I'd love that.

350
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,081
<i>[J.D.] There's nothing more difficult</i>

351
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,387
<i>than letting go</i>
<i>of someone you cared about.</i>

352
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,984
She was a great old gal.

353
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,997
- She was.
- [Hedrick] Hey!

354
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,794
Acceptance!

355
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,027
[Kelso] Damn bikes!

356
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,438
Boy, sometimes
you've just got to love Kelso.
