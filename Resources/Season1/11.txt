1
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,800
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

2
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:08,650
<i>When you spend every</i>
<i>waking moment in a hospital,</i>

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,766
<i>it's hard to get into the spirit.</i>

4
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,377
Are you aware that
you're in everyone's way?

5
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:16,784
Everyone's way?

6
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,984
Or your way? Think about it.

7
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:24,254
Think about it?
I'll think about it.

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:27,446
<i>Still, there are</i>
<i>some traditions I enjoy.</i>

9
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,375
<i>Like Nurse Tisdale's 9. 15 cup of coffee.</i>

10
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,559
- Carla, what time is it?
- I don't know

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,290
but I'm guessing
it's about 9.15ish.

12
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,702
This thing!

13
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,721
- Who put this up?
- I did.

14
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:03,023
I drove round the whole city
before my 5am shift,

15
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:05,962
just looking for that.

16
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:08,279
Trying to add a little cheer.

17
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:11,335
You will not ruin my Christmas.
Not again.

18
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,171
Not this year.

19
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,640
I've only worked here for three months.

20
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:22,039
<i>Things could be worse. I could be with</i>
<i>Elliot doing my day in the free clinic.</i>

21
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:24,613
I understand that you took a cab here.

22
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:28,765
But I can't give you Vicodin
because your teeth are itchy.

23
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,134
Dr Kelso?

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,264
I don't want to sound insensitive, but
why don't these people have any money?

25
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:39,355
I don't know, sir,
they probably waste it all on food.

26
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,649
I need you to precept a patient.

27
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:45,259
19-year-old with abdominal pain.
She's eight months pregnant.

28
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,054
I'll let the family practice people
handle it.

29
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:52,239
Wonderful idea, except
I heard your smart-aleck remark

30
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,140
so why don't you keep
your little pregnant girl?

31
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:59,535
lt'll be good practice since you'll
probably end up in a female specialty.

32
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,019
What do you mean by that?
I'm internal medicine.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,610
Well, of course you are.
But numbers don't lie

34
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:10,887
and most women end up in OB-G YN,
family practice or paediatrics.

35
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:14,341
It's like a riptide, sweetheart,
pulling and pulling,

36
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:17,203
and you can swim against
the current all you want.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,155
When Mr Stork comes a-calling, you won't
think, ''I'm internal medicine.''

38
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:28,283
It's gonna be, ''Oh! Look at the baby!''

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,339
Sir, I have to say, I'm offended.

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,249
Oh, no. Now I have to go
buy flowers to make it right.

41
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:57,225
Newbie, stay.
What a good boy you are.

42
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:00,758
Dear God, Judy,
how much product do you use?

43
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,977
None. It's like this when I wake up.

44
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:04,952
Quick tip, there, sports star.

45
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:09,950
When you're defensive about your
feminine side, it makes you more girly.

46
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,712
- You want something?
- Nobody likes a cranky punching bag.

47
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,234
And yes, it's about a patient.
Pretty good friend of mine.

48
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:20,737
<i>I guess that means</i>
<i>he respects me a little.</i>

49
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,608
Randy, Jackie, what do you say?

50
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:28,510
This is the monkey I got
to videotape the birth.

51
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,116
<i>I hate him.</i>

52
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,904
<i>But not as much as</i>
<i>I hate moments like these.</i>

53
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,219
<i>There's nothing I can do for him, but</i>
<i>when I go in, the family'll look at me</i>

54
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,041
<i>like I've got some</i>
<i>magical power to fix him.</i>

55
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:48,510
Hey, everybody!

56
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:04,610
I'm sorry, it's been two weeks, and your
son shows no neurological improvement.

57
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:10,013
It was a miracle! First of all, the man
was near dead. Then he comes out.

58
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:13,460
- You're ridiculous.
- I'm telling you it was a miracle.

59
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,595
- It was not a miracle.
- Yes, it was. Dude...

60
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:20,600
I envy Turk. To be that sure
of something, to have that faith.

61
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,735
<i>That doesn't mean I don't</i>
<i>love busting him about it.</i>

62
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,458
You think God was responsible
for his recovery?

63
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,878
That's fine.
We all have our beliefs.

64
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:33,909
I carry around this tiny little
Monopoly piece for good luck.

65
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:36,995
Did you compare my Lord and Saviour
to a tiny top hat?

66
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,277
He did, I heard him, baby.
Go get him.

67
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:43,372
Excuse me, Nurse Teresa.
Have you ever read the Bible?

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,339
I started it. Then I skipped to the end
and it ruined it for me.

69
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:51,904
That's it. Both of you to the window.
Let's go. Right now.

70
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:58,085
''When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.''

71
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:01,106
Matthew, 2:10.

72
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:04,996
Dude, that's just
a Christmas tree in the park.

73
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,229
I understand what you're saying.

74
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:10,362
Please. You can't just jump back
on my good side.

75
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:12,644
You see all of this right here?

76
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,703
And this?

77
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,859
And this?

78
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,227
Consider yourself cut off.
Full love embargo, baby.

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,570
- That's not gonna last.
- It will last.

80
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:24,105
- Yeah?
- It's gonna last.

81
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:29,009
What if I came up to you, all tired,
and I just... I had to yawn...?

82
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:33,631
Damn!

83
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:38,169
- How pathetic is that?
- Do it again.

84
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,830
Please.

85
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,809
This is from last night.
The Christmas tree over at Miller Park.

86
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,615
God, I love that tree.
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

87
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,376
- I've been there almost...
- Listen, Meredith.

88
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:54,883
You're pregnant.
Pretty far along, actually.

89
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,871
What? That's not possible.

90
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,149
What am I supposed to do?

91
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,976
''Look at the baby!''

92
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:09,023
Babies aren't really my thing,

93
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:12,288
so I'm just gonna go get you
someone else to talk to.

94
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:19,476
It's great to see you guys again.
Really, all three of you.

95
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,647
What is it with friends
wanting to be in your life?

96
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,493
Selfish is what it is.

97
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,719
I got Randy and Jackie in the divorce.

98
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,540
<i>My God, his ex-wife.</i>
<i>The tension actually hurts.</i>

99
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:33,729
<i>You have to break it.</i>
<i>Say something. Anything!</i>

100
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,826
Banana hammock!

101
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,701
Your ability to thrive under pressure
is what drove you to medicine.

102
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,515
You should have seen him
when he was a new intern.

103
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,619
''I. Don't. Want. To. Be. A. Doctor.''

104
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:51,531
You know, I think we all know
that's just not true.

105
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:57,017
I'm assuming, since you
already took everything else,

106
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,380
that you're here for my self-respect,

107
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,391
but there's bad news
on that one, sweetcheeks.

108
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:07,198
I already gave it to your mom
when she begged me to marry you.

109
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,806
I wouldn't have room for it, what with
your testicles in my trophy case.

110
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:15,861
Holy cow.

111
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:18,830
Who's better?
You got me by the short hairs.

112
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:20,229
See ya.

113
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,726
What do you hate most
about the holidays?

114
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:27,146
- Wrapping presents. You?
- My family.

115
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,971
I don't know how anyone
can get in the spirit here.

116
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,289
Come on, guys. All the spirit
you need is right here.

117
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:35,578
Can I get a amen?

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,309
<i>Turk's always been good</i>
<i>at rallying people.</i>

119
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,626
Congregation, I said,
can I get a amen?

120
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,036
Amen!

121
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,540
'Tis the season of givin', y'all.

122
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,085
What better place to give
than right here at Sacred Heart?

123
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:54,648
Lovest thou me,
then feed my sheep!

124
00:07:56,198 --> 00:08:00,749
Right here, at Sacred Heart,
we are not only gonna feed his sheep...

125
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,691
...but we gonna clothe them.

126
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,307
- And we gonna bathe them.
- Bathe them!

127
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,253
And we gonna cut 'em open.

128
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,377
Then we gonna stitch 'em
right back together.

129
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:17,060
Because that is what
Christmas....

130
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:18,826
...is all about.

131
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,438
That's right! Preach, preach!

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,359
What's the name of the song
we're singing today?

133
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:14,120
Right, listen.
I'm on call tonight.

134
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:18,477
But tomorrow morning, when I get home,
we're going to Mass before work, OK?

135
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,217
OK, sweetie.

136
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:22,720
<i>I don't wanna go to Mass</i>
<i>in the stupid...</i>

137
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:25,169
<i>Candy!</i>

138
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:30,943
I was trying to...

139
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,757
I know exactly what
you're trying to do, but...

140
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:36,999
you're not gonna break
my Christmas spirit. You can't.

141
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,729
Not ever. I'm the Holly Jolly Janitor.

142
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:43,635
Little girl. What do you want
for Christmas...?

143
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:48,803
I know you must be busy. It's really
nice of you to offer to do this.

144
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,733
It's no problem.

145
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,816
<i>Childbirth has been so romanticised.</i>

146
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,585
<i>I guess because if people</i>
<i>knew the truth...</i>

147
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,088
<i>Congratulations!</i>
<i>You're expecting.</i>

148
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:05,601
<i>Your doctor will tell you</i>
<i>everything you need to know.</i>

149
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,063
<i>Hi, doctor.</i>

150
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:10,753
You'll fart, pee, puke and poop
in front of ten complete strangers

151
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,638
who'll be staring
intently at your vagina,

152
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:17,987
which, by the way,
has an 80% chance of tearing.

153
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,100
You do it.

154
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:26,287
<i>Still, no matter what the realities,</i>
<i>the end result is always the same.</i>

155
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,435
Look at the baby!

156
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,162
It's a bouncing baby boy.

157
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:37,268
Yet another soldier
in the fight against Communism!

158
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:48,514
- Where's the girl that was in here?
- I just make beds.

159
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,475
I got Meredith Fox's blood work.
She's got HELLP syndrome.

160
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,621
She needs to deliver
immediately so let's get...

161
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,685
What do you mean she just left?

162
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:03,760
Get me any contact numbers.

163
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:07,120
- Why did she leave?
- Again. Bed-maker.

164
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:14,317
Newbie, I always punch
the tabs out of my tapes

165
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:16,997
so there's no way
they can be recorded over.

166
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,503
So please tell me you didn't use
the tape that was already in the camera.

167
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:24,599
Banana hammock.

168
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:28,334
So, in other words,
there is no permanent historical record

169
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:31,853
of the birth of my friend's baby?

170
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,992
Well, I think that the baby itself

171
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,518
would serve as proof that it was,
you know...

172
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,343
...born.

173
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,911
You don't understand
what you've done.

174
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:48,210
My ex-wife is gonna hold this
over my head for so long

175
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,388
that I doubt I'll ever
see the sun again.

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,037
And I liked the sun, Newbie.
It made me hopeful.

177
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,632
Well, I was there.

178
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,526
I could certainly jot down some of my...

179
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,806
...feelings and impressions.

180
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:09,178
<i>If he was really mad at me,</i>
<i>he would have stayed and yelled at me.</i>

181
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:13,038
<i>Don't kid yourself.</i>
<i>I couldn't be any madder at you.</i>

182
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:18,040
<i>No, do not do that again.</i>
<i>That's a bad Newbie.</i>

183
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:25,172
<i>I can go home now. Maybe</i>
<i>it's because Christmas is a hard time,</i>

184
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,734
<i>or because too many families</i>
<i>get together,</i>

185
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:32,444
<i>but Christmas Eve, it's one of the</i>
<i>worst nights of the year to be on call.</i>

186
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,960
I can't believe I'm wearing a suit
at 6.30 in the morning.

187
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:21,303
If you ruin this for Turk,
I'll hurt you.

188
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,153
Noted.

189
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,121
You better hurry up.
Mass starts in 15 minutes.

190
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:31,639
- I'm not going.
- Great. Can I go back to bed?

191
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,904
I'm kidding. I wanna get
some of them church crackers.

192
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
No, I'm not going.
Ever.

193
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,136
Baby, what happened?

194
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,608
Turk? Turk, come on...

195
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,717
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

196
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:52,785
You're overreacting.

197
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:56,604
A girl said, ''What am I gonna do?''
and I said, ''Babies aren't my thing.''

198
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,886
How could I be too hard on myself?

199
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,096
<i>Just don't say</i>
<i>''Banana hammock''.</i>

200
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,990
Look, I'm sure she'll turn up.

201
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:08,469
That's exactly what's gonna happen.
She'll turn up, have a healthy baby

202
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:12,047
and nothing'll ever happen
to either one of them.

203
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:15,115
<i>I never really thought</i>
<i>of faith as important.</i>

204
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>But without his, I don't know,</i>
<i>Turk kinda seems like he's fading away.</i>

205
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,311
<i>I could use a little faith. I have to</i>
<i>tell them I didn't tape a thing.</i>

206
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,821
You made some interesting
choices with the camera, Orson.

207
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,483
- You didn't want any faces?
- Excuse me?

208
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,826
I switched the tapes.
Just go with it.

209
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,207
Here it comes, I see the head!

210
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,381
- What a gorgeous head of hair.
- That's funny.

211
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:42,354
He was bald when he was in here
a few minutes ago.

212
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,712
- Yeah, well...
- We shaved the baby.

213
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,890
- You shaved the baby?
- Shaved it.

214
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,103
Standard procedure. What with
the recent outbreak of pre-natal lice.

215
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,878
Yep. Definitely.

216
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,031
Shave and haircut.

217
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,015
Two bits.

218
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,516
Really?

219
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:06,924
I'm not buying it.

220
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,965
You two are gonna go by the
nursery and see baby Charlie?

221
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,243
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

222
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,575
Charlie and his new haircut.

223
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:23,141
- Have we checked the other hospitals?
- They haven't seen her, honey.

224
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:27,588
Dr Reid, isn't this your day off?

225
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,767
- It's that pregnant girl...
- The one who went missing.

226
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:35,259
And now you're here, voluntarily,

227
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,165
hell bent on finding
one of your little lost ducklings.

228
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:43,404
It's important you understand something.
I'm not interested in babies.

229
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,823
I don't melt when I see them,

230
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,674
I don't have a yearning
to make them my life's work.

231
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,996
I'm a doctor interested in my patients,
male or female.

232
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:54,775
Right now, one of them needs help.

233
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:58,040
God! Do I know women.

234
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:03,442
I don't get it. Why are we on the roof?

235
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:08,000
I wanted to show you that no matter
how ugly things can get down there,

236
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:10,582
there's still a lot of beauty up here.

237
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:15,725
Is that... gum or pigeon crap
on my sneaker?

238
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,829
Come on, look around.

239
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:21,753
There's nobody here,
no one can see us.

240
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:24,706
We could do whatever we wanted.

241
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:26,394
Like what?

242
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,179
How are you not getting this?

243
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,611
You mean have relations.

244
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:34,716
You wanna have relations
right here on the roof.

245
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:38,395
The pebbles will make my ass
look like a chocolate chocolate chip.

246
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:43,188
I can make you see God again,
or at least call out his name.

247
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,067
Is this a joke to you?

248
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:47,900
No, I'm just trying
to help you feel better.

249
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:50,938
- You don't know how I feel.
- Well, then tell me.

250
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,219
I feel abandoned!

251
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,804
All my life, I've believed
that God listens to our prayers,

252
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:02,422
and that he cares for us
and that he watches over us.

253
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,819
Last night, so many people
needed to be watched over.

254
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:14,227
How am I supposed to believe in someone
that's gonna let innocent people suffer?

255
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,827
Answer me, please.

256
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:20,573
I can't.

257
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,812
Did you see baby Charlie yet?

258
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:29,286
Oh, yeah, I was just planning
on doing that. Never.

259
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,477
You're such a special friend.

260
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:34,560
Gosh, Marjorie,
aren't you sassy today?

261
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:38,689
Did Santa finally bring you that
Y chromosome you always wanted?

262
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:42,940
- What's your problem, anyway?
- For starters, I hate Christmas.

263
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,750
I don't like bambersnoodles,
I loathe dinkerwallows,

264
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,989
I hate snagtumgopers,

265
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,006
I say, do you follow?

266
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,008
Do you think I'm a moron?

267
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:58,608
Don't answer that question.
It's a trick, that's a trick.

268
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:00,833
Pre-natal lice?

269
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,650
You do realise that
would be lice in the womb?

270
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,122
I've seen them,
they're real and gross.

271
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:10,096
<i>Maybe Dr Cox had pushed me too far.</i>
<i>Whatever it was, I told on him.</i>

272
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,992
Plus, he didn't even
go see baby Charlie yet.

273
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,182
<i>And then something amazing</i>
<i>happened. They connected.</i>

274
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,995
<i>And all the hatred</i>
<i>they had for each other</i>

275
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,630
<i>was suddenly focused on me.</i>

276
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,418
Excuse me, Sally Sensitive,
I don't remember asking you anything.

277
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,016
Your mom's aware she'll
have to stop breast-feeding?

278
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,763
Good Jordan, good. Now work the body,
under the ribs.

279
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:38,834
I'm not gonna see that baby either.
Are you gonna tattle on me? Are you?

280
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,202
- I'm frightened.
- Do you have a second?

281
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,215
- God, yes.
- Run away.

282
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:46,537
I spoke to a 911 operator
who got a call from a girl in labour,

283
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,484
but they lost the signal.
I don't know what to do.

284
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,800
<i>One of the worst things</i>
<i>about this place</i>

285
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:55,414
<i>is how often you feel like</i>
<i>there's no one to turn to.</i>

286
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,714
You'll be OK.

287
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:59,091
<i>Babies are amazing.</i>

288
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:02,087
<i>Especially the way</i>
<i>they bring people together.</i>

289
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,290
So, baby Charlie is the bald one?

290
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:08,939
Yeah. He wouldn't be smiling so much
if he knew how ugly his parents were.

291
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:13,560
- You're a se<i>xy</i> bitch.
- Thanks.

292
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:20,351
<i>I really think it's impossible</i>
<i>to be unaffected.</i>

293
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,240
What up, little dawg?

294
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:29,334
<i>A baby can stir something deep down</i>
<i>inside you, you didn't know was there.</i>

295
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:32,105
Look at the baby!

296
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:35,040
<i>They help you find something</i>
<i>you thought you'd lost.</i>

297
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,443
How did you know she was here?

298
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,662
I don't know, I just knew.

299
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:43,237
<i>I guess Turk was right after all.</i>

300
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,573
<i>Miracles do happen.</i>

301
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,305
<i>I think you just have to</i>
<i>be willing to look for them.</i>

302
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:10,261
Merry Christmas, guys.

303
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,887
God bless us, every one.

304
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,356
Dude, you could not be a bigger dork.

305
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,533
You're so lame.

306
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,109
That was so cheesy.

307
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:25,246
Really?
Cos I felt like it was... right.

308
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,427
Wait up!

309
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,120
