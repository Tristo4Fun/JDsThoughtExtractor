1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,594
- Say ''ah''.
- Ah.

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,945
- OK, say ''oh''.
- Oh.

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:11,291
Everybody say ''Ah, oh, ah!''

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:15,203
Excuse me.

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,779
As legal counsellor,
it's my job to inform you

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:23,614
that your suspension
is effective immediately.

7
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,809
Just the messenger.

8
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:29,896
Your long-term job status will
be decided at the board meeting.

9
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:34,227
Until then, and I cannot bend on this,

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,290
I don't want you
setting foot on the premises.

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,613
- I'm going to be here all day.
- Works for me. That'd be good.

12
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,751
I hope that works out.

13
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,113
Dr Cox, if you need to talk...

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,694
<i>It was weird knowing my mentor</i>
<i>could be fired tomorrow.</i>

15
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,678
<i>But there's no reason</i>
<i>to feel any less confident.</i>

16
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>I'll be fine without a safety net.</i>

17
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,907
What do you think, Dr Dorian?
Bypass or stent?

18
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,578
Bypass!

19
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,691
Or stent.

20
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,523
<i>There's a lot of horrible things</i>
<i>about being an intern.</i>

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,665
<i>Long hours, constant stress,</i>
<i>having to deal with death.</i>

22
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,956
<i>But worst is the simple fact</i>
<i>that the average intern</i>

23
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:36,645
<i>has to disimpact 15 to 20 bowels a week.</i>

24
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:40,197
<i>There's an oath among interns</i>
<i>never to make fun of each other</i>

25
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:42,707
<i>for doing the things we have to do.</i>

26
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,327
You have to touch someone's hiney.

27
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,646
Dorian, come with me. And Dr...

28
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,337
- Reid.
- Sure. Why not?

29
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,475
Take over for him.

30
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:55,985
I'm assigning you to a board member

31
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,194
whose family built this hospital
with their bare hands.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,241
<i>That can't be true.</i>

33
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,404
- Look for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- What happened?

34
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:08,411
- Pre-syncope.
- So, this board member almost fainted?

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,467
- I'll fire up the paddles.
- Dr Weisenheimer's back.

36
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,742
- How was your ski trip?
- I'm confused.

37
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:15,596
- You annoy me.
- Now I get it.

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,388
But you have a charm
everyone else here seems to respond to.

39
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,356
Use it. OK, sport?

40
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:25,110
<i>Great, an 80-year-old,</i>
<i>grouchy, pretentious...</i>

41
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,347
<i>...smokin'-hot bitty.</i>

42
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,038
<i>Who do you love the most?</i>

43
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,337
Sweetheart, are you getting younger?

44
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,653
This is Dr Dorian.

45
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:50,302
- He'll be looking after you.
- And who will be looking after him?

46
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:01,085
Since your jaw is wired shut,
we'll give you IV nutrition, OK?

47
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,542
Sorry. It's like the dentist.

48
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:07,160
They ask you questions and
you have that stuff in your mouth.

49
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:10,067
I did it again. Dr Greenberg.

50
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,024
What kind of doctor are you?

51
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,308
I keep doing it. Just act it out.

52
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,868
Head?

53
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,689
Shrinking. A shrink!

54
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,416
I can't imagine picking
psychiatry as a specialty

55
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,540
after interning as a real doctor.

56
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,937
That didn't come out right.
My dad. He's a doctor too.

57
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:34,717
He says therapy is for people
with more money than problems.

58
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,922
But then... my dad says a lot of things.

59
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,547
- Did anyone page a nurse?
- No.

60
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:46,915
- It looks like his eyes are screaming.
- Please, we're talking.

61
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,244
Where was I?

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,597
- You should get dressed.
- I can't. It's still out there.

63
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:59,368
Don't call my mother ''it''. It implies
you think that she's a monster.

64
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,374
Get a move on,
it gets up to feed about now.

65
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,647
I don't understand
why we couldn't stay at my place.

66
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,861
I could've done the whole show.

67
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,268
- There's a show?
- Yeah, there's a show.

68
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:14,655
It involves music, some dancing,
occasionally singing.

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,948
- Can you do <i>Me And Mrs Jones?</i>
- I don't know, what's she look like?

70
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,198
You wanted to spend the whole night
together. I can't leave my mother alone.

71
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,146
She's frail.

72
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,003
Tell her to put the cane down!

73
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:40,704
- Tell her to put the cane down!
- It's because I'm unmarried.

74
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,982
She doesn't have to know we had sex.

75
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,546
- She speaks English.
- Then why translate?

76
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,574
You don't speak Spanish!

77
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,178
No! No!

78
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,426
Tell her to put the cane down.

79
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,019
I have to be honest,
when Dr Kelso said

80
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,250
board member, I was thinking
this like old, grumpy...

81
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,536
That would be my father. He died.

82
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,152
- I'm so sorry.
- 20 years ago.

83
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,783
I would have said sorry then
but I had trouble with my Ss.

84
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:17,279
I was five. Ss.
So... how are you feeling?

85
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,122
Great, that's why I'm here. Listen, RJ.

86
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,469
- JD.
- Like it matters.

87
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,931
You seem like a nice, spineless, boy,
so let's be honest.

88
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,310
I'm here because it was the only way to
end my mother's nagging pseudo-concern.

89
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,968
- That's sweet.
- So, do your little tests.

90
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,315
But first, close the blinds,

91
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,699
wash off your 8th-grade-dance cologne
so we don't add nausea to my symptoms.

92
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,116
I'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling
water, which you've yet to get.

93
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,979
- Let me just...
- Doing things I want first.

94
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,739
- Your little tests later.
- Nice to meet you.

95
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,331
<i>I hate you.</i>

96
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,387
Merry Christmas!
I mean, happy Halloween!

97
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,993
I am so frazzled.
I did not sleep at all.

98
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:02,623
In fact, I haven't really slept
since I started here.

99
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:09,323
It's so much pressure. I can't talk
to anyone here. It's so competitive.

100
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,649
I used to be able to talk to
my mom, but now, I don't know,

101
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,423
she listens, but she just never
seems to hear me, you know?

102
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,434
Lonely, depressed, overwhelmed.

103
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,146
And sometimes I have no idea
how I'll make it through this.

104
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,362
No. I don't even like to take aspirin.

105
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,197
I'd rather just...

106
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,831
Oh, you!

107
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,972
Dr Cox. I've been
thinking about your predicament

108
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,952
and I think I have a solution:
cruise ships.

109
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,986
- Right.
- Everyone'll call you Doc.

110
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,396
You'll visit exotic ports.
Maybe you'll even get to meet Charo.

111
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,333
Enjoy this while you can, Bobby.

112
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,927
If your evil genie
does grant your wish,

113
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:00,196
and I disappear,
the only person you'll have left

114
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,535
to contend with will be yourself.

115
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,069
And when you really
get to know that person,

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,416
dear God, you'll scream so loud,

117
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,985
Satan will want to rip up the contract
you signed so he can get some sleep.

118
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:16,462
Look at you with your stiff upper lip.

119
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:19,153
I think I'm gonna miss that the most.

120
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,983
What are you looking at?

121
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,880
I just... I like your shirt.

122
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,515
- What kind of shirt is that?
- A white T-shirt.

123
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,300
I knew it.

124
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,784
I will never sleep
at your place again.

125
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,525
It wasn't that bad.

126
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,588
I am in such a good mood.

127
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,071
Does she invite the priest over
every day?

128
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,302
Only when she finds me in bed
with some guy. So most days.

129
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,952
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

130
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,536
I'm just in a much better place.
Do I look different?

131
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,050
What kind of a shirt is that?
I am such an idiot.

132
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,189
I'm in a better place.

133
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,082
What do you say, my apartment, tonight?

134
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,114
I'll think about it.

135
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,082
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

136
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,998
In a better place,
look different, feel good.

137
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,561
That's what happens
when you see a shrink.

138
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,708
My patient is a therapist.
I'm not seeing a shrink.

139
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,639
Stop spreading around
embarrassing rumours.

140
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,072
I'm just goofing around. The last thing
I want to do is upset a crazy lady.

141
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,742
- T-shirt.
- Is anybody up there?

142
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,240
Up there... up there... up there...

143
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,426
I'm all alone down here...
here... here...

144
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,239
It's cold.

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,635
I'm frightened.

146
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,798
<i>Just keep moving. Refocus.</i>

147
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,069
<i>Think about helping Dr Cox.</i>

148
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:59,872
Ms Sullivan? Sorry. I didn't
realise you're in the bathroom.

149
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,671
It's OK, come on in.

150
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,069
Come in the room, not in here.
What's the matter with you?

151
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,730
Are you even a real doctor?

152
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,520
I know that you're on the board, and I
have this friend. Well, he's a mentor...

153
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,876
- Losing interest!
- Sorry.

154
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,089
Why are you dressed?

155
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:23,657
I'm going to a party.
I assume my tests are normal.

156
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,048
But I sure hope we can go down
to the river some time and race frogs.

157
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,591
<i>That's it.</i>

158
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,045
Listen, you spoiled,
bossy chore of a woman.

159
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,953
- What'd you say?
- <i>You're in now, go for it.</i>

160
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,036
I'm the doctor here.
So put your gown back on,

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,238
get back in bed and shut the hell up!

162
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,572
- No one talks to me that way.
- Get used to it, missy.

163
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,109
I didn't mean to be
such a hard ass, just now.

164
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,415
You can wait until I'm gone
to put your gown back on.

165
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,472
- Take off your pants.
- Yes, ma'am.

166
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,873
I know it's tough
leaving your mother at home.

167
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,660
- I'm really glad you're here.
- You are?

168
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,852
Yes, I am.

169
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,745
And I promise I'm going
to make it worth your while.

170
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,631
We've already slept together.

171
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,388
You should be careful
about the build-up.

172
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,494
- Is that necessary?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,742
I got something for you.

174
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,113
You want to hear it?

175
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,663
Did you learn that for me?

176
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,365
More.

177
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,224
<i>The start of a relationship</i>
<i>is about three things.</i>

178
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,165
<i>Control.</i>

179
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,554
Oh, God!

180
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,176
<i>Dependence.</i>

181
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,684
He was released
a couple of hours ago.

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,871
<i>And timing.</i>

183
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,953
Your mother broke her leg.

184
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,925
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>there aren't a lot of surprises.</i>

185
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,802
Dr Cox have you met...?

186
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,354
You don't have
to introduce me to my ex-wife.

187
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,877
Surprise!

188
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,187
You putz.

189
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,329
- <i>Oh, no.</i>
- Hello, Jordan.

190
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,354
- <i>Oh, no, no.</i>
- Perry.

191
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,993
- Perry?
- You never heard that.

192
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,867
<i>And I don't have your ex-wife's</i>
<i>bite mark on my neck.</i>

193
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,030
Don't look her in the eyes.
She'll steal your soul.

194
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,437
How are things down in the underworld?

195
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,737
Good. And you?
Still have a rollicking social life?

196
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,070
Since I cut you loose
it's been one big party.

197
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:56,765
Name some place, other than the
hospital, you've been in the last month.

198
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,607
Five, four, three, two...

199
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,286
My car!

200
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,033
On the way to the... big party.

201
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,510
That must have hurt.

202
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,644
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

203
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,410
<i>Anger like this has a way of being</i>
<i>passed on to whoever's closest.</i>

204
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,565
Dr Cox, I know you're suspended but
you're the only one my mother trusts.

205
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,779
Not now!

206
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,981
This is all your fault.

207
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,578
- Turk, can I talk...?
- No. You can't.

208
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,550
That's why they're called
your problems.

209
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,566
Sorry.

210
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,465
Happy Halloween.

211
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,861
That'll teach you not to spy on
people during their alone time.

212
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,179
<i>When dealing with a crisis, everyone</i>
<i>knows you go right to the source.</i>

213
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,162
<i>God, the source is pretty.</i>

214
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,993
Ms Sullivan?

215
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,748
Excuse me?

216
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,103
I think we're way past Ms Sullivan.

217
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,515
OK, Jordan...

218
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,625
I don't think
we should see each other again.

219
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:20,747
The story of my life. Any time I let
my guard down just a little, I get hurt.

220
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,041
I am so sorry.

221
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,575
You know how long it's been
since I connected with someone?

222
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,355
It's not fair that because of him,
I don't get to spend time...

223
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,592
It's hard to keep that going.

224
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,080
See you, DJ, I got a date.
''See each other again!''

225
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,499
She's gonna be OK.

226
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,132
I don't know, Mom,
I'm just feeling lost.

227
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,918
Everyone here is so busy,
and I guess I'm just kind of lonely.

228
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:58,391
Could you just try to hear
what I'm saying? Just this once?

229
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,465
No, I don't have short hair.

230
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,711
Yes, I know short hair
gives me pig-face.

231
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,198
Yeah.

232
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,749
- Dr Cox!
- OK, Linus.

233
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,042
You're too excited. Get your blankie,
go in a corner, and take a time-out.

234
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,906
Non-displaced femoral fracture,
Carla's mom's gonna be fine.

235
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,821
- OK, what?
- Your ex-wife.

236
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,454
- She's the answer.
- Things That Ruined My Life?

237
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,051
Things With Sharp Edges?

238
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,153
She's on the board.
I'm sure she's a reasonable person.

239
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,720
Not that I know her
or have been alone with her.

240
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,392
- But if you just...
- No.

241
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,610
- Ask.
- I'm going to go and do this

242
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,704
as slowly as possible
so you don't misunderstand.

243
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,673
No...

244
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,715
<i>I wonder if he wants me to ask her.</i>

245
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,599
Fine, I'll ask her.

246
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,138
<i>That's a no.</i>

247
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,932
- It's always funny.
- Can't believe she's sleeping.

248
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,945
She's had two Valium.

249
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,657
- Why, was she in a lot of pain?
- No, she just wouldn't shut up.

250
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,940
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,231
I notice your little boyfriend's
name's not on the cast.

252
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,124
Making me leave her alone like that?

253
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,127
She would have gotten hurt,
whether you were there or not.

254
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,074
She fell in the shower.

255
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,006
So unless you have an extremely
disturbing relationship,

256
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,646
- I'm afraid you're full of crap.
- I'm full of crap?

257
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,957
If you don't care about being
suspended, why are you here?

258
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,138
You don't scare me
with those crazy eyes.

259
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,705
She's an excuse to not take chances.

260
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,409
- You're only happy when you're here.
- You're afraid to live your own life.

261
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,446
Admit that losing this place
would kill you.

262
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,484
- We done?
- That's all I got.

263
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,627
Crazy eyes?

264
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,997
Low blow.

265
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,598
<i>There are other ways</i>
<i>to save Dr Cox's job.</i>

266
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,226
<i>I could try talking to Dr Kelso.</i>

267
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,302
<i>Cox could get plastic surgery</i>
<i>to look like Jimmie Walker.</i>

268
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,510
This guy's gonna need 30mEqs of KCL.

269
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,838
<i>Or I could just ask Jimmie Walker</i>
<i>to talk to Dr Kelso.</i>

270
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:20,893
Your man Cox is the best. I know he's
got an unorthodox way of doing things,

271
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,144
but all the innovators do.

272
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,829
Now, everybody deserves
a second chance.

273
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,017
Am I right?

274
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,812
Who are you?

275
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,823
<i>Or I could get back</i>
<i>to the problem at hand.</i>

276
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,426
I know you're on your way
to the board meeting

277
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,091
and I know
you don't really like me, but...

278
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,284
I don't dislike you. I nothing you.

279
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:48,056
Thanks, that's special.
I have to ask you a favour.

280
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,688
But this is not why we slept together.

281
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,195
You had nothing to do
with why we slept together.

282
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,581
I think we both know
that's not completely true.

283
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,642
Even though you're terrified
Dr Cox will find out,

284
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,411
if I wanted you to have sex with me
in front of him, you would.

285
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,526
Please don't do that.

286
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,765
You remind me of him
when he was younger.

287
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,979
Then see if you can dig up sympathy

288
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,594
for someone who means a whole lot to me,
and probably means a little to you, too.

289
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,037
- So will you help him?
- Ah, sweetie...

290
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,477
No.

291
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,501
- I went to therapy once.
- You did?

292
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:32,150
Yeah. Once though,
like, back in '93 to '94.

293
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,337
Then a few months in '95.

294
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,424
And then I went to group,
which was a disaster.

295
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,394
When I went to college it was
my first time away from home.

296
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,556
Things started piling up
and I felt I was sinking.

297
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,605
- Yeah.
- And no matter how embarrassing

298
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,571
you think it might be, it's always
helpful to talk to someone neutral.

299
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,018
For example, take a look at me.
I am now, thanks to therapy,

300
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,914
in a healthy relationship
with a beautiful woman,

301
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,157
who won't sleep over because
she thinks I broke her mother's leg.

302
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,232
Baby!

303
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,018
How long were you back there?
For a second, huh?

304
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,934
- I wasn't talking about us...
- Turk.

305
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,128
Mom's spending the night here,
so I will spend the night with you,

306
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,584
only we have to leave right now.

307
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,754
Go.

308
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,560
<i>Sometimes no matter how badly</i>
<i>you want to stop something,</i>

309
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,013
<i>there's nothing you can do to stop it.</i>

310
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,477
<i>The board of directors</i>
<i>of Sacred Heart</i>

311
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,862
<i>is behind that door sipping water</i>
<i>and killing the career of Dr Cox.</i>

312
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,002
Yes. I am bullet-proof.

313
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,206
- <i>He's taking it well.</i>
- So, no hard feelings?

314
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,460
- Careful.
- Catch you on the flip side.

315
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,876
I really think
you're making a big mistake.

316
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,535
- The most destructive thing about Dr...
- Yawn!

317
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,887
I say yawn because when I actually yawn,
you don't get it.

318
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,531
See you in hell.

319
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,128
<i>I don't know why she did it,</i>
<i>maybe I got to her.</i>

320
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,836
<i>Maybe she knows how much</i>
<i>the hospital needs him.</i>

321
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,150
<i>Maybe she remembers why</i>
<i>she cared about him in the first place.</i>

322
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,044
I did it cos the thought of you
rotting here in this fluorescent tomb

323
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,203
is more fun than tipping a valet
with your alimony cheque.

324
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,901
Listen, pumpkin, if you're having
this much trouble getting over me,

325
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,290
just go ahead and give me a call,

326
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,346
and I'll toss you
a sympathy throw-down any time.

327
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,308
<i>It made me realise</i>
<i>every ending leads to new complications.</i>

328
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,619
<i>New problems to be dealt with.</i>

329
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,976
I'm watching that.

330
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,024
- <i>New issues.</i>
- Thanks, Dr Greenberg.

331
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,074
See you next week.

332
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,002
- She was never boring.
- What happened?

333
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:01,204
You marry somebody like your mother
then remember you hate your mother.

334
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,547
You asked her for help, didn't you?

335
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,994
You don't realise how important
you are around here.

336
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,900
<i>I'll always remember that as</i>
<i>the first thank-you I got from Dr Cox.</i>

337
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:16,583
Jeez, Agnes. Does the field-hockey team
know that you're missing?

338
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,212
<i>It felt good.</i>

339
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,832
Although it did take
some stones to be honest.

340
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,356
Stick with the truth and you can't
get hurt. Always been my philosophy.

341
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:35,029
- You didn't sleep with her, did you?
- God, no.

342
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,444
<i>Philosophy is tricky.</i>

343
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
