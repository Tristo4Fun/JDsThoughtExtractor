1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:04,193
<i>As a first-year intern,</i>
<i>you have little free time.</i>

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:08,402
<i>When you have a night off, it's</i>
<i>important you do something constructive.</i>

3
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:37,344
- How's it goin'?
- I have no idea who you are.

4
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,922
What's up, dude?

5
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,631
<i>Wait a second. He's dating Carla.</i>

6
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,133
<i>This is not good.</i>

7
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:52,138
First, I already told her
I got a girlfriend.

8
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,369
Second, you just put
your bare lips on my ear.

9
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,940
- How's it going? I'm...
- JD, I know.

10
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,927
He won't stop talking about you.
I'm Jennifer.

11
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:06,524
Do you really spend every day
saving children's lives?

12
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,640
Tell the nice lady.

13
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,605
I do what I can.

14
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:15,124
It's on! It's on.

15
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:19,314
- It's on!
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

16
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,683
<i>I know two things about bars.</i>

17
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:24,056
<i>One, they're packed</i>
<i>Thanksgiving week.</i>

18
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,673
<i>Two, put a beer in my hand</i>
<i>and I'm Mr Smooth.</i>

19
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:30,779
I was laughing so hard,
milk was coming out of my nose.

20
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,656
I once tripped over an IV
and blood shot over everyone.

21
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:41,222
A little got on my nose.

22
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,857
Every damn day, saving those children.

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,679
Who wants margaritas?!
Dude, less blood, more fruity drinks.

24
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,157
Right.

25
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,342
<i>Turk hasn't changed a bit since college.</i>

26
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,312
<i>He's the same goof ball</i>
<i>who tells me how to be cooler.</i>

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,873
Dude.

28
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,860
- This girl's hot. So don't blow it.
- Why do you say that?

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,864
Because you're like a 24-hour
convenience store. You never close.

30
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:08,628
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.

31
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:16,852
Don't worry about it, I feel good
tonight, know what I'm saying?

32
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,198
Good.

33
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,802
Except for this stabbing pain
in my side.

34
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,591
Up all night with a high fever,
cramping and crying.

35
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,232
- Dude!
- My bad.

36
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:31,139
Not crying, punching the wall all manly
and angry like, you know what I mean?

37
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,422
See ya later, buddy.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,593
Poor Bambi. Don't worry.
Carla will take care of you.

39
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:41,369
- Make sure he's admitted right away.
- All right.

40
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:45,681
<i>On the bright side, it'll be interesting</i>
<i>to see what it's like to be a patient.</i>

41
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,140
You know people die here?

42
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,011
You're a good friend.

43
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,037
I do what I can.
Can I have your stuff?

44
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,954
So did you talk to any girls last night?

45
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,369
I'm an attractive man,
we both know this.

46
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:17,913
It's a burden
you're gonna have to live with.

47
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,980
One of many.

48
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,486
JD talked some girl up.

49
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,925
Really? Are you gonna call her?

50
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:31,506
Not right away.

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,134
Showtime.
Clear out so I can check him out.

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,738
You're examining me? I don't want you
to see my unmentionables.

53
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,637
I've seen underwear before.

54
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:44,944
I use the word unmentionables
for my genitals as well.

55
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:49,103
68-year-old male
with respiratory distress...

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,653
Save your breath.

57
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,317
Hello, Dad.

58
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,987
Never thought you'd call me that again,
after I left.

59
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,117
- Dr Cox!
- Relax, Carla.

60
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,464
The man I'm smothering
isn't my father.

61
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,925
Dr Benson used to be
Chief of Medicine here.

62
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,306
Hi, how are you?

63
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:18,262
Still have that great rapport
with the nurses?

64
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:22,926
Carla totally gets me. That's why I've
systematically tried to drive her away.

65
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,279
Ever see that therapist I recommended?

66
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,737
Not yet, no.

67
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,333
Shortness of breath? Dizziness?
Problems urinating?

68
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:37,148
No. No...
Is it a problem if it whistles?

69
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,178
You're making this so much easier.
Are you sexually active?

70
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,427
It's active.

71
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:47,041
I'll write ''rare dry spell''
in the margin.

72
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,869
OK, time for the physical.

73
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,330
Cold hands.

74
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,214
Suck it up!

75
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:05,089
<i>Elliot's exam was reminiscent of when my</i>
<i>older brother beat the crap out of me.</i>

76
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:07,704
God!

77
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:10,829
See, it wasn't so bad. All done.

78
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:14,947
I'm puking every hour
and my fever's high,

79
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:17,491
but you're sure it's OK
for me to be out of bed?

80
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,229
I don't know. Dr Benson was my mentor.
Don't do that annoying thing.

81
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:23,546
- What annoying thing?
- When you talk.

82
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,717
Come on.

83
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:27,607
- Does that not drive you crazy?
- You get used to it.

84
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:31,604
I know you're excited with the gown on
but at no time are you to curtsy.

85
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,819
<i>He can say what he wants.</i>
<i>but he's showing me off.</i>

86
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,146
Dr Benson.

87
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:40,241
Just give us a second, will ya, big guy?
Did you hear about her?

88
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,373
<i>Watching Dr Cox,</i>
<i>I realised we never really stop</i>

89
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:46,812
<i>craving the attention</i>
<i>of people we look up to.</i>

90
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,148
Any questions?

91
00:05:58,263 --> 00:05:59,537
Good.

92
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,681
- He seemed nice.
- Careful, Newbie.

93
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:07,083
I'm hearing it now.
It is kind of annoying when I talk.

94
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:11,226
<i>In a lot of relationships, you regress</i>
<i>to the person you were when you met.</i>

95
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,793
So Elliot's exam was that bad?

96
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,182
- Dude, she violated me.
- In a good way?

97
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:17,956
What's the deal?

98
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,913
I think I broke my ass!

99
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,226
You're telling everyone I violated you.

100
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:26,963
Not everyone, just the people
that work here. And my parents.

101
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,480
Was there something wrong
with my exam?

102
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,661
<i>So there it is. The classic trap.</i>
<i>Two choices.</i>

103
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,317
<i>Either wuss out</i>
<i>or tell the truth.</i>

104
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,348
You're kinda rough.

105
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,867
You're rough and
you're a little businesslike.

106
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,134
- You're cold.
- You mean my hands?

107
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:47,745
Yeah, those too. I just think
you could be more comforting.

108
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,369
<i>I could tell she appreciated</i>
<i>how hard it was for me to say that.</i>

109
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,281
Do you know how annoying
you are when you talk?

110
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:55,885
<i>Maybe not.</i>

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,505
- I was watching that.
- It's broken.

112
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:09,368
Dr Cox. Did you get my memo
reminding senior staff

113
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:12,094
that lab coats
must be worn at all times?

114
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:16,254
You know, I did get it, Bob,
and at first I just threw it away,

115
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:19,500
but then I decided that
wasn't a grand enough gesture.

116
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,187
So I made a replica of you
out of straw

117
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,938
and then I put my lab coat on it
with your memo in the pocket,

118
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,175
then invited the neighbourhood kids

119
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,992
to light it on fire
and whack it with sticks.

120
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,675
So, I have been looking
at Dr Benson's chart.

121
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,972
His chest x-ray was normal,

122
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:42,864
his vitals are stable,
so let's discharge him.

123
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,275
Now hold the phone there, skipper.

124
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:50,481
Dr Benson should be able to stay here
until he feels he's ready to go.

125
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,148
Give me a break, he was
only Chief of Medicine for ten years.

126
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:59,055
Well, I haven't had my coffee yet,
so I'm finding it hard coming up with

127
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:02,652
a more colourful way to say
''Who gives a crap?''

128
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,411
Actually, that wasn't half bad.

129
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:12,389
Our next patient
is a 26-year-old male

130
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:16,723
who has presented vomiting,
abdominal cramps and fever.

131
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:19,704
<i>I never realised how hard</i>
<i>rounds are on the patient.</i>

132
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,895
<i>It feels like you're on display.</i>

133
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:25,668
Still, Rodin's masterpiece
makes us wonder,

134
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,902
why didn't he spend
a little less time thinking

135
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,352
and a little more time at the gym?

136
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,628
I do cardio.

137
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,548
Which most likely indicates what,
Dr Reid?

138
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,948
He has a simple case
of appendicitis.

139
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,250
How would you proceed,
Dr Dorian?

140
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:47,819
I would give me that news in private,
no matter how angry I was at me.

141
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,852
Sounds like there's a
fascinating back story here.

142
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:53,575
Turf him to surgery. Moving on.

143
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:58,246
Watch it, Bambi. You don't want
a 100lb white girl mad at you.

144
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:01,079
You'll flinch every time
you hear a Range Rover.

145
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,191
I can't believe I have to
spend all Thanksgiving here.

146
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,524
- Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
- Not really.

147
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:10,542
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving
in your homeland?

148
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:14,706
- You mean Chicago?
- You have a Chicago?

149
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,915
Be nice to me. I'm getting surgery.

150
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,682
- Dr Wen is the attending.
- Who's the intern doing the work?

151
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:25,714
<i>I get to cut you open</i>
<i>I get to cut you open</i>

152
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:33,542
Go, girl!

153
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,438
Go get it.

154
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,488
<i>Good God.</i>

155
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:43,291
Mr Davis,
you won't be home for Thanksgiving

156
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,922
but you'll be eating leftovers
by Saturday.

157
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:48,266
Great. And doctor, thank you so much.

158
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,362
You're welcome.

159
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:55,553
We've gotten to know each other
over the last week, haven't we?

160
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,020
I'd say so.

161
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,045
You found me comforting?

162
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,964
God, no.

163
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,803
I'm pretty good with people.

164
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,797
- You're horrible.
- I'm warm.

165
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:08,005
You're very cold. I mean, your hands...

166
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,258
- It's like you're a yeti.
- I have bad circulation.

167
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,863
I do this all day and it doesn't help.

168
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,019
Listen, sweetie, you're
a very efficient, competent doctor.

169
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:21,709
But your exams...
Do you examine everyone like that

170
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:25,015
or just people you feel
have wronged you in some way?

171
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,036
- I appreciate your opinion.
- It's not an opinion.

172
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,471
You see those guys right there?

173
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,891
They're pretending to be asleep
so you won't manhandle them.

174
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:37,194
- They are not.
- Dude, what are you doing?

175
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,926
Too frank, right?

176
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:44,238
I know. It's probably why my mom
pushed me down the stairs.

177
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:48,102
She is fat, though. And boring.

178
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,938
BP's 60 over palp.
Is he having a heart attack?

179
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,370
It's hypotension and
electrical alternance on the monitor.

180
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,432
This is tamponade.

181
00:10:56,603 --> 00:11:00,994
Viral infections can cause pericarditis
and a rapid accumulation of fluid.

182
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,232
It looks like a heart attack
but don't let it fool you.

183
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,480
BP's stabilizing.

184
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:09,930
- What have we got?
- Don't worry. We're fine here.

185
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:13,912
<i>It's a universal feeling to want</i>
<i>to be there for a good friend.</i>

186
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:17,791
<i>So from now on, I'm going to stop</i>
<i>seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.</i>

187
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,315
Dr Turk, if you will?

188
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,929
We'll mark for the incision
right about here.

189
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:26,527
<i>After all, he's a highly trained,</i>
<i>competent young doctor.</i>

190
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,237
Dude!

191
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:32,901
I'm about to bust a mad
sliz-ice in your insides!

192
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:38,975
Sir, I'd prefer if someone other
than Dr Turk performed the surgery.

193
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,742
Fair enough.

194
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:44,810
Dr Cotter will perform
the procedure tomorrow morning.

195
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,659
<i>The best thing about friends is how</i>
<i>quickly things like this blow over.</i>

196
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:59,833
- You understand, right?
- Whatever, man.

197
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,435
You want some salsa
for that chip on your shoulder?

198
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,948
I can't believe you. I would never ever
do something like this to you.

199
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:11,208
- You're like school in July.
- What do you mean?

200
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:12,861
No class.

201
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,772
You're not supposed
to scare me like that, sir.

202
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:26,257
It was just a prank.
Admittedly, I took it too far.

203
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,203
Well, I still laughed, but...

204
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:32,282
I felt a little guilty
I wasn't here administering...

205
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,766
I just came to check on
my favourite patient.

206
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,110
I must have the wrong room.

207
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:40,483
- How are you, Dave?
- I'm doing great, Bob.

208
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,018
I owe you one.

209
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,045
Hey, doc, you should
go ahead and get some rest.

210
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,005
I'll be out of your hair soon.

211
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:52,610
Just a sec, skipper. You'll stay here
until you decide you're ready to leave.

212
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:57,682
For God's sake, you were the Chief
of Medicine here for over ten years.

213
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,726
Am I right?

214
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,716
That was what I said this morning.

215
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,935
Yeah, it sounded familiar.

216
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,484
- What?
- I was wondering

217
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:18,297
how you comb your hair
so the horns don't show?

218
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,486
I wonder what bothers you the most?

219
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,655
Is it that I saved his life
and he likes me as a person?

220
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,230
I bet it's how much
he respects me as a doctor.

221
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:29,570
How does that taste?
Bitter? Hard to get down?

222
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:38,212
- Here you go.
- Great.

223
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,462
Carla, everyone likes you so much,
it makes me wonder...

224
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:44,994
- Why patients think you're a cold fish?
- My God, you noticed?

225
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,064
- Honey, they told me.
- Great. If anyone needs me,

226
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,956
I'll be in the supply closet
eating sugar packets.

227
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:53,984
Look, Elliot...

228
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:59,453
I'm not the kind of person who likes
telling people what to do, but...

229
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:03,491
Here's what to do. Here's what I think.
Here's what your problem is.

230
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:06,023
Don't think of your patients
as strangers.

231
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,406
I'm dating Turk, I get it.
Sometimes he is a big kid.

232
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,417
But when it comes to work, he's
as capable and mature as anyone.

233
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,064
Take those out.

234
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:18,092
Baby, I was being a walrus.

235
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:22,461
JD's not only your friend
but a patient too, and he's scared.

236
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:27,004
Kelso is pushing your buttons.
Every now and then let something go.

237
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:31,106
Turk's not that mature. He spent
all yesterday being a walrus.

238
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,589
He had straws and stuff...

239
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,975
The only thing
JD's scared of is sharks.

240
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,191
And he has a weird thing with pennies.
He's not scared about this.

241
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:46,368
Kelso's not just some harmless
guy pushing my buttons, Carla.

242
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,940
He's a pod person.

243
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,518
- You're wrong.
- You're so wrong.

244
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:53,704
<i>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong</i>

245
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,771
<i>You're wrong.</i>

246
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:06,414
I think you're right. I don't know
how to connect with patients.

247
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:11,081
Start by touching them, holding
their hand, or stroking their hair,

248
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,474
or give them
a reassuring pat on the arm.

249
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:17,166
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You'll be great.

250
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:22,149
Darn right.

251
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,819
There you go, sir.

252
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,807
I'm sorry. It's my watch, I'll get it.

253
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:47,397
I'm so sorry. Let me...

254
00:15:54,859 --> 00:16:00,013
Dave, at Sacred Heart we don't
treat symptoms, we treat people.

255
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:03,474
- There's something on your back.
- What does this one say?

256
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,535
''Never stop kicking me.''

257
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:10,944
And on the other side
is my discharge form.

258
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,566
Bob, you tried to discharge me
an hour before I almost died?

259
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,192
Well...

260
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,727
How very clever.

261
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,158
What? It wasn't me. In fact...

262
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:27,783
I think you put it there
yourself to get more attention.

263
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:35,105
It was me. I put it there.

264
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:43,366
Hey, buddy. OK,
forget about everything that's going on.

265
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:47,325
We know that you're bummed out
about missing Thanksgiving so...

266
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,013
we decided to bring it to you.

267
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,596
Wow, guys, thanks.
Where's the food?

268
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,840
Who wants the unmentionables?

269
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,848
Bambi? Your fever's spiking.

270
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:11,209
They're worried your appendix might
burst so we're going into surgery now.

271
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,627
Who's on call?

272
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,524
Dr Turk, let's get started.

273
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:26,865
<i>Most doctors don't believe in</i>
<i>the out-of-body experience thing,</i>

274
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,234
<i>and I don't know</i>
<i>if it was real or a dream,</i>

275
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:32,882
<i>but I swear I was up there</i>
<i>watching Turk operate on me.</i>

276
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:36,196
<i>And I have to say,</i>
<i>he's an amazing surgeon.</i>

277
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:40,985
Dude, could you not look over
my shoulder while I'm doing this?

278
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:42,968
It's a little unnerving.

279
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:47,685
You've got a little fever.
Probably atelectasis from lying in bed.

280
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:50,725
- I'm really uncomfortable.
- I'm so sorry.

281
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:54,847
- You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- I'm done with all that.

282
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:58,654
If it makes you feel better,
I hate this touchy-feely culture.

283
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,969
Thank you.

284
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,465
That whole ''kiss hello'' thing.

285
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:05,327
I don't want anyone touching me
unless we have sex.

286
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,648
Even then I don't want them
to overdo it.

287
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:10,784
- Where in Connecticut are you from?
- Greenwich. You?

288
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:14,465
Darien.
I'm really burning up here.

289
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,403
God, that's fantastic.
It's like an ice pack.

290
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,858
Yeah.

291
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:27,345
I'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Are you at least close with your dad?

292
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:31,383
You see this right here?
That's his work.

293
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,280
Pretty good for a man
in a wheelchair.

294
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:37,549
Doc, I'm sorry you gotta be here
on Thanksgiving night.

295
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:41,481
My wife can't cook anyway, she's 22.
What are you doing?

296
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:45,205
Forget about me. What's your wife
look like? Any pictures?

297
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,517
Not of this one.

298
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,213
You know, being back at this old place,

299
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,607
you know the thing I have found
to be the most disappointing?

300
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,024
I think I can guess.

301
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,201
You.

302
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:02,452
Probably because you do things
like show up the Chief of Medicine,

303
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:06,150
when anybody who's been in a room
with Bob Kelso for two minutes

304
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,817
knows how big an ass he is.

305
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:12,565
- Go easy, I just thought...
- You don't think, Perry.

306
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,363
You're such a talented doctor.

307
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,509
If you played the game you'd be in
a position to change things around here.

308
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:24,490
But you're too stubborn for that,
aren't you?

309
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:29,036
All right, kid.

310
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,633
Gin. Your deal.

311
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,457
Hi. I just need to
check on your incision.

312
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,792
- Turk, I was an idiot.
- It's OK, man.

313
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,043
No, seriously, man. I want you to know,
if I ever need surgery again,

314
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,741
I want you inside of me.

315
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:58,929
I want to be the one inside of you.

316
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,522
Look, JD, I get it.

317
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:11,276
To me you'll always be that geeky kid
with the Pat Benatar t-shirt.

318
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,012
Dude, she rocks.

319
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:17,872
I want you to know
how serious I am about what I do.

320
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:20,276
Did you stitch your initials into me?

321
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:25,009
That's not important. It's still
Thanksgiving for 20 more minutes.

322
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:29,725
Now, you can have ginger ale

323
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,360
and a cracker.

324
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,919
I forgot. Your change. Two pennies.

325
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:39,861
Get those pennies away from me.

326
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,389
Happy Thanksgiving, man.

327
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:44,475
<i>I guess what they say is true.</i>

328
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:47,527
<i>The people you work with</i>
<i>really do become your family.</i>

329
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:49,931
<i>Like your brother.</i>

330
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:53,461
<i>And your sister-in-law.</i>

331
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:56,775
<i>Or that cousin</i>
<i>you have funny feelings for.</i>

00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:14,383
Nobody talk.

00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:16,988
Just drink.

337
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:21,178
<i>Uncomfortable silences</i>
<i>and alcohol.</i>

338
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,033

00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,192
Drink!
