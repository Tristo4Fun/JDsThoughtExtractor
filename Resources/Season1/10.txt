1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,730
What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:09,941
Wondering how to tell my roommate

3
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:13,073
he drives me crazy,
without hurting his feelings.

4
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,560
Sarcasm works better
when it's shorter.

5
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:18,544
- Fascinating.
- See, there you go.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,085
So what're you doing?

7
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:24,368
- You're annoying me.
- I'm OK with it.

8
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:28,467
I've had such a crappy morning I decided
to come out here and eat my lunch.

9
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:32,392
This spot feels secluded.
It's so peaceful.

10
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,435
I'm getting my spirit back.

11
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:39,308
- It's just a bench.
- Sit down, sweet thang.

12
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:51,953
Nice. You know, I've already eaten,
but I could...

13
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,633
- What's it gonna take?
- Your cupcake.

14
00:00:56,996 --> 00:01:00,227
This is how I get my spirit back.

15
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:07,484
I feel alive again.

16
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:18,362
<i>It's time to change this pattern.</i>

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,034
- Morning.
- How do you figure?

18
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,061
Doing a little drilling?

19
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:28,232
I have an idea. Let's go the whole day
without getting in each other's hair.

20
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:32,478
Just give each other a break?
What do you say?

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,049
I'm gonna give you a nickname.

22
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,554
That's good.
I already have a nickname. It's JD.

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,743
How about... Whinyface?

24
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:46,727
Whinybritches?

25
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,554
Whinysomething.
I definitely like whiny.

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,232
Whinydancer.

27
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,337
I can't believe
I went out last night.

28
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,521
You said you were exhausted.

29
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,611
I was.
But I figured I owed it to the ladies.

30
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:21,057
Do you ever stop giving?

31
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:24,716
<i>It's hard for doctors and nurses</i>
<i>to be long-term friends.</i>

32
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,667
His O2-sat's dropping.
He just needs respiratory treatment.

33
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:31,719
<i>When you start out,</i>
<i>the nurses know more than you.</i>

34
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:36,679
<i>After a few months, the training kicks</i>
<i>in and you both feel the dynamic shift.</i>

35
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,600
I think because of the congestive
heart failure, he just needs Lasix.

36
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:48,179
<i>The future of the relationship depends</i>
<i>on how she handles that very moment.</i>

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,874
I'm so proud of you, Bambi.

38
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,500
They grow up so fast.

39
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:12,351
- Dr Cox.
- And there you are.

40
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:16,097
- Excuse me?
- I was wondering if there's anything

41
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:19,494
that could push my headache
into a full-blown migraine.

42
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:22,031
And there you are.

43
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:26,297
- What's the story on the admit in 64?
- She's great. I really like her.

44
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:30,714
Let's see if you can't focus on things
I give a rat's ass about.

45
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:31,972
What?

46
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,862
She blacked out at work.
Accelerated heartbeat.

47
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,298
Interesting.

48
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:39,405
I don't care if it wasn't
good first-date conversation,

49
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:44,644
Michael deserved to know what
I think about circumcising babies.

50
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,468
What? Actually, no.

51
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:49,774
No, it wasn't, which is
surprising cos he's Jewish.

52
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:53,438
- I gave her two Valium.
- I'm e-mailing you as we're talking.

53
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,788
How cool is that?

54
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,355
So she's actually sedated as we speak?

55
00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,587
OK, bye.

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,870
Elliot. OK, first impressions.

57
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:04,092
- Did I scare Michael off?
- No.

58
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,144
Not if he enjoys a big fat cup of crazy.

59
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:11,296
Ms Tracy, we're all busy,
so if we could...

60
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,957
I have the same e-maily-pagey thingy.

61
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,664
Get out!

62
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,740
- My H sticks a little bit. Does yours?
- It does!

63
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:27,494
It may just be a bench,
but you know what?

64
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:31,858
It's quiet. And I can chill.
It's like my special place.

65
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,005
You are so damn cute,
I can't even stand it.

66
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:36,408
Serious?

67
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,267
I love it that my man's
all deep and whatnot.

68
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,584
- You know, I get deep.
- I know.

69
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:45,277
- What's happening, Rerun?
- What up, Roge?

70
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,801
How about some of this?

71
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,412
It wasn't even that good a show.

72
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,961
- Take it back.
- This second.

73
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,109
Look at the time.
Gotta go, it's lunchtime.

74
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:00,762
See ya, baby!

75
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:04,615
- We still on for the Bresson exhibit?
- Yes, we are.

76
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:08,781
- Did you just ask out my girlfriend?
- You wanna come?

77
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,076
Black-and-white photography,
no boobies.

78
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,647
Hell, no.

79
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,770
- Hello, sir.
- Nice spot.

80
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,201
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,463
I usually try to get out here
for lunch every day at 12.30.

82
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:32,639
You don't say?

83
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:36,203
Every day, 12.30, for 23 years.

84
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:41,906
From now on, your name is Scooter.

85
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:45,823
- I don't get it.
- Short for scooter pie.

86
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,067
I hate scooter pies.

87
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,363
Now I see.

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,860
<i>You big jerk.</i>

89
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:57,277
Thanks again for the invite, Bambi.
I love photography.

90
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:01,258
Photography's for studs.

91
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,458
<i>After working at a hospital for a while,</i>
<i>you develop a sixth sense for danger.</i>

92
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:11,398
<i>Maybe there's a mass cas alert,</i>
<i>maybe there's a code...</i>

93
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,053
<i>Maybe someone spent the morning</i>

94
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,540
<i>with an annoying patient</i>
<i>and needs to vent.</i>

95
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,607
<i>Luckily, I was prepared.</i>

96
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:24,076
- You do your pre-rounds?
- Yes.

97
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,799
Discharge summaries?
Pharmacy renewals?

98
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:29,506
SOAP notes?
Central line changes?

99
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:30,692
Yes.

100
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,344
OK, but did you
go ahead and fix your beeper

101
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:40,215
so it doesn't play that annoying
song every time you get paged?

102
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,538
Yes.

103
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,069
<i>Crap.</i>

104
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,348
I expect you to act like

105
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:52,473
a professional around here!

106
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,074
Is that all you got?

107
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:57,507
Good one.

108
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,267
Interesting titbit.

109
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,437
Back during the gold rush
when a man staked a claim,

110
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:09,330
if he came upon another man
panning his spot,

111
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:12,208
he could shoot that fella dead

112
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:15,246
without even asking any questions.

113
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:18,096
You don't say.

114
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,284
Simpler times.

115
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,231
What if you've had three great dates
and he likes you so much

116
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:30,506
he hasn't even tried to have sex
with you yet?

117
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,760
I could sabotage that relationship
in two phone calls.

118
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:37,332
- I could do it in one.
- Sabotage that relationship.

119
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:40,282
I would ask him
why he finds me so repulsive.

120
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,950
Then, coerce him
into having phone sex with me,

121
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:46,144
then I would ask him
if he thinks we have a future,

122
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:49,435
and then I'd probably just cry
until he hung up on me.

123
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,669
- We are so alike.
- I know!

124
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,828
''Oh, stop.'' ''No, you stop.''

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,519
Oh, dear God.

126
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,464
- Ms Tracy, we'll go ahead...
- Can you give me one sec?

127
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:07,912
I'm arranging to have food delivered.
Fatty had a party and nobody came.

128
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,213
Preaching to the choir.

129
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,775
Think of what little patience I have

130
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,172
as your virginity.

131
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:21,467
You always thought it would
be there until that night

132
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,079
when you were feeling down,

133
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,074
and your pal, Kevin,
who just wanted to be friends,

134
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,715
he dropped by and he brought
a copy of 'About Last Night'

135
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,625
and a four-pack of Bartles & Jaymes.
And...

136
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:39,792
It was gone for ever.
Just like my patience is now.

137
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:43,432
So you do scary little speeches?

138
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,300
- How adorable!
- This is so much fun.

139
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,428
Careful, Rapunzel.
Fun time is officially over.

140
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,035
You think you can just treat Bambi
like that and walk away?

141
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:57,574
Get him, girlfriend.

142
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:00,043
What up, T-Dog?

143
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,697
<i>The only way to avoid</i>
<i>the high five with Todd</i>

144
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,810
<i>is not to say anything</i>
<i>that he can connect to sex.</i>

145
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,381
How you doing?

146
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,802
That's totally how my car was rocking
when I took this girl out last night.

147
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,615
Am I right?

148
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,424
<i>He earned it.</i>

149
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:24,526
Pain.

150
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,026
- So Cox tore into you?
- You know what pisses me off?

151
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,168
No one ever calls him on anything.

152
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,902
You want to kick and scream,

153
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:37,054
that's fine, but if you ever yell
at my friend again over nothing,

154
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:40,219
then I will wipe
that scary smile off your face,

155
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:42,904
and keep it in my purse
until no one around here

156
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:44,902
is any more scared of you than I am.

157
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:49,581
It's not fair.
Why are you eating in here?

158
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:53,821
- T-man's afraid of Kelso.
- I'm not afraid of Kelso.

159
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:56,190
I just felt like eating in here.

160
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:59,883
Go outside and stand up for yourself.

161
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:02,158
Hell, yeah.

162
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,936
You know what else
stands up for itself?

163
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:12,085
I'm not sure.
But I'll guess that it's your penis.

164
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,822
It is.

165
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:15,402
<i>Oh, no.</i>

166
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:19,691
Everyone, we can all relax now.
The planets have been realigned

167
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,493
and order shall be returned.
Hey, you.

168
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,723
Give me two seconds.
Gotta finish e-mailing Jill.

169
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,533
I have
your little friend's test results.

170
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,009
Shall we have some fun
and take a look?

171
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:34,949
Interesting. EKG, negative.
Tilt table, negative.

172
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,474
Echo, negative.

173
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,973
Nothing, in fact, is wrong with her
but exhaustion, brought on by...

174
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,088
let it come... being her.

175
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:49,842
- Yeah, but if you don't...
- No, no, no.

176
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,159
There's no time for ''Yeah, buts''.

177
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:54,809
I want her out of here in five minutes

178
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,320
or you will be responsible
for covering every missed shift

179
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,864
during this year's flu season.

180
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:03,288
Now go.

181
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:05,752
Hey, you...

182
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:10,170
For what it's worth,
I don't care if your beeper plays

183
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:13,161
<i>Who let the dogs out?</i>
<i>Hoof, hoof</i>

184
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:16,798
- as many times as you like.
- Actually, sir, it's ''who, who''.

185
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,741
- But thank you.
- And, by the way,

186
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:24,590
just a real smooth move
running to your mommy.

187
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:28,711
- Excuse me?
- Your mommy cr-rushed me.

188
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,873
She did. I'd like to issue
a warning to everybody,

189
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,045
and I'm dead serious.

190
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:37,413
FYl: JD's mommy
has made it clear

191
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,673
that she doesn't want her
daughter picked on any more.

192
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,724
Nothing mean. She's a precious flower
and we should all be super nice to her.

193
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,564
I was paged.

194
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:05,896
Hello?

195
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,871
Anyone?

196
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,033
Oh, hell, no!

197
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,456
When I get out, we should hang.

198
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,464
I'd love to. I should warn you,

199
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:21,627
I work a ton and when I'm off,
I catch up on paperwork

200
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,919
or read medical journals
to stay ahead of the curve.

201
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm a nerd.

202
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:30,318
I wish I could stay home and read,
but my job, it's like, you know?

203
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:35,558
With the married-by-the-millennium
thing, I go on like, 1,000 blind dates.

204
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,694
And all my friends
always need something.

205
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:44,378
There's me who never wants to
let anyone down, you know, ever.

206
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:49,902
With so many balls in the air, sometimes
it gets a little overwhelming.

207
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:55,172
As soon as I leave, I know
I'm going right back to that mess.

208
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,793
My God, I'm practically crying.
How pathetic is that?

209
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:06,187
<i>Around here,</i>
<i>you make big choices every day.</i>

210
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,906
I came to tell you
we're gonna keep you here

211
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:11,173
for the weekend, just to get some rest.

212
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:16,963
<i>Most of these choices actually</i>
<i>have nothing to do with medicine.</i>

213
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:19,386
It's so on.

214
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,607
<i>In those cases, you have to make sure</i>

215
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:24,501
<i>that your emotions</i>
<i>don't get the best of you.</i>

216
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:26,935
<i>Mommy.</i>

217
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:34,606
- Give me that, Bambi, that's not a toy.
- My name is not Bambi.

218
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:38,507
It's Dr Dorian.
I don't need to be looked after.

219
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:43,353
How about I'll be the doctor
and you be the nurse.

220
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:45,468
Yes, doctor.

221
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,630
<i>Good choice.</i>

222
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:57,879
I have to go check on something.

223
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,218
<i>Fix this before word gets around.</i>

224
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,519
Carla, wait.

225
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,452
What did you do?

226
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:08,166
- What did you do?
- What did you do?

227
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,922
She called me Bambi
in front of everyone.

228
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:14,433
- My name is not Bambi!
- It's Scooter!

229
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,710
Short for scooter pie.

230
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:22,028
Baby, JD is my best friend,

231
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:26,768
but if you need me to kick his ass,
I will kick his ass, cos I care for you.

232
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:30,810
- And cos I'm willing to sleep with you.
- Hell, yeah.

233
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,052
If I wanted
his ass kicked I'd do it myself.

234
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:37,789
Todd,

235
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:41,051
if you ever make that noise at me again,

236
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:44,069
I will reach into your mouth
and unscrew that bulb

237
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,511
that barely keeps your brain going.

238
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,664
Dude, chick threats are hot.

239
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,988
What did I say about annoying Carla?

240
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,761
If she makes me choose between you two,
you know how it'll end up.

241
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:01,075
Yes, I do. And I thank you for that.

242
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,013
Could you be any cuter
with the new hair colour?

243
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:11,339
Holy cow! Please, no.

244
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,343
Good morning, sunshine.

245
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:20,125
Could you possibly
excuse me for just one second?

246
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,937
Dear God, you're still here.

247
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:28,868
Who exactly is doing this to me?

248
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:33,516
<i>There's nothing worse than</i>
<i>knowing you've wronged a friend</i>

249
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:36,136
<i>and having to apologise.</i>

250
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,291
- Look, Carla...
- It's OK. You overreacted.

251
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,654
I should've realised
you can stand up for yourself.

252
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:46,032
I know you would take it back
if you could. I do.

253
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,137
We're OK, right?

254
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:51,739
- I think I've said all I can.
- See you tonight for the exhibit.

255
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:56,126
- Why'd you have me paged?
- To ask you to forgive me.

256
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:57,908
For what?

257
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:00,531
Hello, sad clown.

258
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,725
- Thanks for paging her.
- How could you?

259
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:07,653
He called me cutie and said my eyes
were as blue as the ocean.

260
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,897
I got confused.

261
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:16,605
- It probably would've worked on me too.
- You're damn right it would've. Come.

262
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,710
Is he single?

263
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:21,026
Hello?

264
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,082
Look at you, all proud.

265
00:16:24,298 --> 00:16:26,937
Don't tell me
you've already managed to eat?

266
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,931
I took my sweet time, too.

267
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,764
Consider that your last supper.
I'm bored with the games.

268
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:40,091
- Are you forbidding me to sit here?
- This is a public bench.

269
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:44,269
You are as welcome here as I am
but you won't come back again.

270
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:49,646
You know why? Because you
just don't have the mettle.

271
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:53,463
Now get out of here so I can
eat my wife's egg salad sandwich

272
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,580
before the tomato
soaks through the bread.

273
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:03,618
Beautiful day.

274
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:10,269
Did you get into photography
when you were in college or...?

275
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,786
No. Actually, I never went to college.

276
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,898
Don't tell any of my patients
but neither did I.

277
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,823
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

278
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:26,458
No, it was just a joke.

279
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:30,531
I was doing the whole, like,
turn a frown upside-down.

280
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,330
You know what? Hold it.
I don't think we're OK.

281
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:37,374
You accepted my apology.
You can't take it back.

282
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,934
Have you ever spent time with a woman?

283
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:52,133
Is my punishment still coming
because the anticipation is killing me?

284
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:55,067
- Make your case.
- I'm sorry, what?

285
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,573
Well, you tell me
why Chorey McCrazy Chore

286
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,280
gets to stay here two more nights.

287
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:01,910
OK.

288
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:05,737
You don't know how hard it is
for some women to make it alone.

289
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:09,612
Jill is so exhausted.
She's her own worst enemy.

290
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:13,821
Constantly trying to please.
She judges herself harsher than anyone.

291
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,634
Have you seen
what you look like today?

292
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,705
I'm a skank.
She never says no to anyone, so...

293
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:25,112
Could you pick up a sample of my dog's
stool and take it to the vet for me?

294
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:28,013
I can do it at lunch.

295
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:33,196
It's OK.
Jill can stay a little longer.

296
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:36,817
And if we're real lucky,
she'll realise that it's OK

297
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:41,652
to give yourself a break
every once in a while, right?

298
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:54,718
I took a cab from the last stop.

299
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,785
- You forgot your coat.
- I don't want it.

300
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,949
Why would you?

301
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,029
I was only gonna go to that exhibit

302
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:06,279
because I wanted you to think
I was brainy.

303
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:09,858
- I'm so angry at myself.
- Thank goodness.

304
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,045
I thought you were mad at me.

305
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:16,448
Hundreds of interns have decided they
don't need me any more. Why should...?

306
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,837
This is why you can't
be friends with doctors.

307
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:23,606
If it's a problem, you, me,
Elliot and Turk will get together...

308
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,605
I don't work with Turk and
I'm not close to Elliot.

309
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,726
The only problem here is you, OK?

310
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:34,291
We're supposed to be friends.

311
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:38,037
Your self-esteem
is so wrapped up in what you do.

312
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:41,673
A doctor. That's all you are.
That's how you define yourself.

313
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,506
You think you're
better than me because of it.

314
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,062
- Carla, I do not think...
- Admit it.

315
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:50,687
Admit it right now
or I'll never respect you again.

316
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,565
OK. Sometimes that's true.

317
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:01,914
- Carla, you're a good nurse.
- I'm a great nurse.

318
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:04,059
You patronising ass.

319
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:09,363
You don't even get it, do you?

320
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,315
In nine years, I never once
felt bad about myself

321
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,961
for what I do, not for one second.

322
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,430
And then I met you.

323
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,305
- Please wait.
- Don't.

324
00:20:57,571 --> 00:21:00,608
<i>Sometimes the only way to</i>
<i>take a good look at yourself</i>

325
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,940
<i>is through someone else's eyes.</i>

326
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:07,995
<i>If you're lucky,</i>
<i>you'll like what you see.</i>

327
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,550
Impressive.

328
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,161
<i>Or you'll learn from it.</i>

329
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,466
<i>If you don't like what you see,</i>

330
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:31,681
<i>you have to hope</i>
<i>you haven't burned too many bridges.</i>

331
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:35,446
How many mEqs of potassium
should I give this guy?

332
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,332
You know the answer to that.
Don't do that.

333
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,572
But thanks, Bambi.

334
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:48,622
<i>From that moment on,</i>
<i>I knew I'd be Bambi for ever.</i>

335
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,822
See you tomorrow, Scooter.
