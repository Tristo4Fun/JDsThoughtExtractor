1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,515
What? I didn't say anything.
I didn't do anything.

2
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:18,666
What imaginary slight have you concocted
in that paranoid brain of yours?

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,384
<i>Crap.</i>

4
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,903
Shouldn't there be
some sort of sign...

5
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:32,977
Look at that. You should put it back
down before someone slips and falls.

6
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:36,230
Good, because I make most decisions

7
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:40,117
based on your opinion. I'm thinking
of splitting up with the wife.

8
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:42,796
Maybe you could mull that over.
Get back to me.

9
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,005
Floor's wet, ma'am.

10
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:51,389
Little help over here.
Little help.

11
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:54,456
Move it or lose it, Q-tip.

12
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:58,980
Q-tip. Cos you're skinny
and your head's fuzzy.

13
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:00,928
Something's going down.

14
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:05,562
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.
Take a knee if you need to.

15
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:09,077
I have been on since midnight,
so I stand here

16
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:11,583
with my usual contempt for all of you,

17
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,727
but with the added wrinkle
of having 13 cups

18
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,931
of piss-poor excuse for coffee
passing straight through me.

19
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:22,469
The not-so-hidden message being,
that if you screw up today,

20
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,164
I'm going to hit you hard and fast.

21
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:29,678
Now, then, I think some of you
may have noticed

22
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,911
that all 27 of the patients
that were here in the ICU

23
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,081
when I started last night
are still alive,

24
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:38,966
and I intend
for them to still be breathing

25
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,322
when I get the hell outta here
tonight at midnight.

26
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:47,862
I think you understand what kind of
opportunity we have in front of us.

27
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,284
- What opportunity...
- Shut up!

28
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,468
In baseball, when a pitcher's hot,

29
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:58,080
no one talks to him,
just stay out of his way.

30
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:02,585
- Why are you talking about baseball?
- Cos you should never jinx a pitcher

31
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,490
when he has a chance
to throw a perfect game. My God, Barbie,

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,777
how do you put your bra
and panties on in the morning,

33
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:13,872
all by yourself?
It's remarkable.

34
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:16,956
- See, cos he's the pitcher...
- Yeah, I get it now.

35
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,581
<i>A chance to be part</i>
<i>of a perfect game</i>

36
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,127
<i>is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</i>
<i>It just never happens.</i>

37
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,884
<i>Which is why I don't mind</i>
<i>Dr Cox paging me</i>

38
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,140
<i>for the 13th time this last hour.</i>

39
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:49,995
<i>ICU is where</i>
<i>the most critical cases get turfed.</i>

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,352
<i>So many patients die here, you</i>
<i>think of death as another co-worker,</i>

41
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:58,853
<i>looking over your shoulder with the same</i>
<i>demands as everyone else you work with.</i>

42
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,594
Dr Dorian...

43
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,832
I know you're busy, but
my daughter's selling cookies.

44
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,324
Put me down for two boxes
of mint thingies.

45
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,465
She's in second place
in her troop.

46
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:14,027
If that girl who's in first keeps
doing well, we're just gonna take her.

47
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,405
Did you think you were gonna cash it in?

48
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,997
In your face.
You're fine, thank you.

49
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,827
Barbie.

50
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,103
Whatever you need, I'm your girl.

51
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,079
Get me 30 grams of Kayexalate.

52
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,003
Don't dilly-dally trying
to refill your Prozac.

53
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:37,877
You're on my time now. Go.

54
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,279
Nervous guy. Go to bed 18
and get me his tox screen.

55
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:44,972
Cross your fingers the news is good.
If it's not, I'm blaming you.

56
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:49,173
Newbie, start a drain on
the purulent pericarditis in bed 23.

57
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:53,055
He's a tricky bastard. He's tried
to die five times on me today.

58
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:56,377
- Keep an eye on him.
- I'm your wingman, Maverick.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,636
I was watching <i>Top Gun.</i>

60
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,609
Did you know that Goose
is the guy from <i>ER?</i>

61
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:04,806
No, I didn't.
But, but please, keep talking.

62
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,823
<i>You have to keep</i>
<i>an eye on things around here,</i>

63
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,861
<i>cos just when it seems</i>
<i>everything's going great,</i>

64
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:15,225
<i>that's when the tiniest thing</i>
<i>can throw it all outta whack.</i>

65
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:21,887
What are you doing? When the lunch lady
asked if you wanted fries, you said no.

66
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,796
- Yeah, but I wanted fries.
- So why didn't you order fries?

67
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,958
Cos I can't have French fries. Duh.

68
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:35,348
Here. Have 'em all.
Have a fry salad.

69
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:37,792
What the...? Turk?

70
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,886
Baby, come on.

71
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:45,263
Girlfriend, you know
I cannot have French fries.

72
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,417
Dr Dorian, I need a favour.

73
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:55,322
- I'm crazy busy today.
- That's just fine, kiddo.

74
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,726
I won't make the board meeting today.

75
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,699
I'm going to be tied up
at Dr Dorian's pity party.

76
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,517
Should I bring something?
I could rent a clown.

77
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,223
A drunk clown hurt me once.

78
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,370
Just listen to the damn lawyer.
Go, Tom.

79
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,343
It's Ted.
But hey, it's only been 12 years.

80
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,621
One of the social workers

81
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:18,842
that covers this hospital slipped
and knocked herself unconscious.

82
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,567
She might turn around and sue us.

83
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:25,728
If that happens, some of the
higher-ups' heads could roll.

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,710
The point is that people
are less likely to sue an institution

85
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:35,494
if we can put a friendly face on it.
You've got a friendly face.

86
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,935
But, sir, I...

87
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:39,544
Sacred Heart is calling for your help.

88
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:43,101
Will you accept the call?

89
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:51,345
This is a special phone. If you don't
answer it, you get to be the intern

90
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,465
who does the physicals
over at the state prison!

91
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,871
Hello?

92
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:59,401
- How are you? I'm Dr Dorian.
- Alex Hanson.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,153
Nice to meet you.

94
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:04,106
Firm handshake. I like that.

95
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,825
<i>Hello.</i>

96
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:11,652
Mr Davis, I haven't seen you in three
months. It's gotta be a record for you.

97
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:15,095
Ignore the dislocated shoulder
and make small talk.

98
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,074
This ought to help with the pain.

99
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,994
So... what'd you do?

100
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:24,514
Some woman just pushed me
off the bus. It was totally unprovoked.

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,542
Mr Davis.

102
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,507
I may have told her
that she smelled like wet ass.

103
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,703
There you go.
Be proud of who you are.

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,156
- You wear too much mascara.
- You be careful now.

105
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:38,057
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

106
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,820
Covering for...

107
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:44,250
Whatever. 36-year-old male,
possible dislocated shoulder.

108
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,190
Great.

109
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:48,344
So, how are you doing?

110
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,513
It just got so cold in here.

111
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:54,206
I think the swelling may have gone down.

112
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:56,515
Yeah, I hope that hurts.

113
00:06:56,697 --> 00:07:00,246
- Oh, no.
- Is this the tox screen?

114
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,722
This does not bode well for you.

115
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,348
Get the results of Mr Chervin's
urinalysis. If the numbers aren't good,

116
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,013
I'm gonna give
one of your kidneys to him.

117
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,168
Ten bucks says
I can make him wet himself.

118
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,975
- Everybody's afraid of Mr Man.
- Laverne, you give good sass.

119
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,651
I got the Kayexalate
and pulled the X-rays,

120
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,439
so I am yours.
Do whatever you want with me.

121
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,028
That came out wrong.

122
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:28,661
I want you to use me.
I don't care how degrading it is.

123
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:29,533
No, no...

124
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:33,605
I know that you like torturing people,
and I am up for that.

125
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:36,498
- I wanna make you happy.
- Marshmallow, hush.

126
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:40,449
This guy needs a lumbar puncture,
and I need an extra set of hands.

127
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,338
- Ready and raring.
- Ginger, get the lead out.

128
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,287
Excuse me.

129
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:48,924
- It puts the lotion on the skin.
- You can do movies and I can't?

130
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,964
It puts the damn iodine lotion
on the skin.

131
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,921
Mr Man!

132
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,968
Dr Dorian, I owe you an apology.

133
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,136
Obviously,
I was unclear when I said,

134
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,616
''Stay in the MRI room
with that patient.''

135
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,882
It must have sounded like,
''Leave and do other things.''

136
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:14,575
Let me rephrase it
so there'll be no more confusion:

137
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,808
Get your ass back down there!

138
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:22,343
You have no idea
how loud that is in here!

139
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,286
I'm sorry. You'll be done in a second.

140
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,070
Was that a good sound?

141
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,206
- Not that good a sound.
- Is it stuck?

142
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,569
''Stuck'' is a literal term.
It's more like ''not moving''.

143
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:39,266
- Pull me outta here!
- I can't. You were unconscious.

144
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:42,864
You could have an injury.
Be glad you're not claustrophobic.

145
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:47,323
- Promise you won't leave me.
- I promise.

146
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:52,521
Dr Cox must have my pager on speed dial.
He's completely on top of me today.

147
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,490
Do you know how much I wish
he was on top of me?

148
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,682
That's naughty.

149
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,249
You make me so mad,
I might actually scream.

150
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:03,244
Every day you bitch
about how hard Dr Cox is on you,

151
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,964
and you don't even realise
that you're his go-to guy.

152
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:10,638
- You're overreacting...
- What has he had you do today?

153
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:13,546
He had me intubate
and extubate Mrs Pollard,

154
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:17,630
float a Swan on Mr Kalka,
a paracentesis, a radial art line,

155
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,156
then place a transvenous
pacemaker for a heart block.

156
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,341
Why? What did you do?

157
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,876
Cream, no sugar.

158
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,880
He takes his sugar, no cream.

159
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:41,051
My arm is breaking!

160
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:43,670
OK. It's not going in.

161
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:46,059
Really? Why don't we try kicking it?

162
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:49,517
- I'll talk to one of our orthopaedics.
- Hurry back.

163
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,736
That guy is the worst.

164
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:54,553
Be nice. He's my boyfriend.

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,106
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

166
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:01,056
He's been dying to run
outta here since he came in.

167
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:04,453
- He did not run out of here.
- You're right.

168
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:08,192
He was fleeing like he was being chased
by a swarm of killer bees.

169
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,467
He said just keep pulling.

170
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,561
Goody.

171
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:17,037
Does this big metal contraption
make me look fat?

172
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,830
More chunky than fat.

173
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:23,389
- JD?
- It's all right. I'm right here.

174
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:28,268
You're such a nice guy.

175
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,920
<i>It really feels like</i>
<i>there's something going on here.</i>

176
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,392
<i>I wonder what she looks like.</i>

177
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,533
Why am I always in your fantasies?

178
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,141
You got a problem.

179
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,898
Why are you squeezing
all my fingers?

180
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:49,005
I'll tell you what I'm not doing.
I'm not checking for a wedding ring.

181
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:51,254
<i>I am so in.</i>

182
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,652
<i>I'm right back out.</i>

183
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,447
I'm sorry about lunch.
I'm a little overtired.

184
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,322
That's OK. When we get home,
we can go right to bed.

185
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,365
That's the thing. I'm beat,

186
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:08,885
so it'd be better
if you crash at your place tonight.

187
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,735
It's a private joke.

188
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:17,864
- What now?
- Watch the attitude,

189
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:22,433
or I won't let you go to the bonfire
with the beach bunnies.

190
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:25,705
<i>I was probably thinking</i>
<i>about the MRI girl,</i>

191
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:31,044
<i>but I believe that giving a friend the</i>
<i>chance to shine was just as important.</i>

192
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:35,545
Sir, it's Dr Kelso.
He's making me baby-sit this patient.

193
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:40,564
It's the bottom of the ninth. If you're
not gonna be my catcher, who is?

194
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,942
- What?
-<i>Play ball!</i>

195
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:52,705
Come on, baby.
Right here. Bring it in.

196
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,060
Dr Cox, you can trust me to help you.

197
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,767
I was top five in my class.

198
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:09,673
That's the noise
I make when somebody lies to me.

199
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,679
But I'll get us this perfect...

200
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,073
- Don't say it!
- ...game.

201
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,861
What part of ''don't say it''
did you not understand?

202
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:20,529
The ''don't'' or the ''say it''?
Help me to help you, Barbie.

203
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:27,679
I should get to work.

204
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:29,852
That would be lovely.

205
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,078
- Elliot, do...
- No time!

206
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:38,641
<i>We all have</i>
<i>important things to do.</i>

207
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,345
Do you know what
Alex Hanson looks like?

208
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,373
He's OK.

209
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:46,980
I don't know.
I don't look at the ladies.

210
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:50,365
Young man, I've been married
for over three decades.

211
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,709
I would've gone there, though.
Hell yes, I would've.

212
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:56,841
Who cares?
No one will ever love you.

213
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:59,651
I don't find her pretty,
but since my wife left,

214
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:03,891
when I look at a woman,
I find it hard to see past the evil.

215
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,334
- Something's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.

216
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:11,246
You always say that,
then you sulk, then you tell me.

217
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:14,962
You haven't known me long enough
for me to ''always'' do anything.

218
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,599
You're always hurting me.

219
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:20,453
- So now you're getting defensive?
- Woman, I am not defensive.

220
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,378
You are, a little bit.

221
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:27,535
Turk, why don't you just take a deep
breath and tell me what's wrong?

222
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:30,360
That did it.

223
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:32,577
I guess we're done here.

224
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,285
Barbie, plates
are wobbling everywhere.

225
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,830
I'm starting pressors.

226
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,055
Or you could transfuse him.

227
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:47,107
- Transfusions are riskier.
- My instinct was pressors.

228
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:50,626
- Know what they say about instincts?
- Stick with them.

229
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,135
- Should you?
- Should I?

230
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,795
You'll have time to think about it on
the bench. That's where you're headed.

231
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:01,228
Get out of here. Go ahead.
Go. Hippety-hop to the barbershop.

232
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,182
''Should I?''

233
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,333
Did she ask what you look like?

234
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:11,822
No, she can tell I'm handsome.
I have a husky voice. ''Hello, baby.''

235
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:14,446
Look into your heart
and see how it feels.

236
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,432
My heart hates ''uggos''.

237
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,904
That's what's wrong with you men.

238
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:23,171
You're so afraid of what you feel.
I'm so sick of it.

239
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,824
So do you know
what she looks like?

240
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,137
Yeah, I do.
But I ain't telling you.

241
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:32,991
Just tell me. Does she look
anything like Jimmie Walker?

242
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:39,205
I'm noticing the bottoms
of your slippers are rather slick.

243
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:43,490
Perhaps they contributed in some way
to the incident this morning.

244
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:46,784
Those are hospital booties,
you moron.

245
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:49,276
And now I'm a moron.

246
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:53,534
Dr Dorian, why don't you take Ms Hanson
out for a lovely dinner?

247
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,996
Dr Kelso, I'm not suing the hospital.

248
00:14:57,219 --> 00:15:00,177
It turns out
I only have a mild concussion.

249
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,300
Alex? He's gone.

250
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:06,911
So, what restaurant
are you taking me to?

251
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:10,418
<i>You're not bad if you want to wait</i>
<i>and see what she looks like.</i>

252
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:13,402
I'm kidding. You don't have
to take me out to dinner.

253
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,886
Are you sure? Cos... OK.

254
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,398
I gotta go. Sorry.

255
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,852
Don't sweat it.
We'll see each other around.

256
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,274
JD, I'm really glad you were here...

257
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,255
Ms Hanson, he's gone.

258
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,738
If I were in your slippers, I'd sue
this hospital for all it's worth.

259
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,121
Really?

260
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:37,691
We could run away together.

261
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:45,006
You know what to do. Be straight
with Carla, no matter how hard it is.

262
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,379
I hate this part.

263
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:52,346
I just don't know
what to do about Dr Cox.

264
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:56,320
- What is going on here?
- I say one thing, he says the other.

265
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,367
I can't take it any more.

266
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,966
Why don't you become a lesbian,
and hook up with some hot model?

267
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:06,114
- What's that got to do with anything?
- I just thought it'd be hot.

268
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:11,890
He's testing you. You can't be afraid
to disagree with him.

269
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:15,487
- You're afraid.
- But I still do it.

270
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:19,332
Get back in the game, Elliot.

271
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,502
Dammit!

272
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:14,155
So close. Dammit!

273
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,970
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,085
I'll be fine.

275
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,183
Perfect game.

276
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:29,378
Call it.

277
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:33,474
There's five minutes left, just
the two of us here. Can't we just wait?

278
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,638
Just call it.

279
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,378
No.

280
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:42,642
We all need this, so, no.

281
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,856
I won't call it.

282
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:50,207
That's the dumbest thing anybody's
said to me around here in a long time.

283
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:55,090
There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter.
In fact, it's miraculous.

284
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:59,526
I won't have you cheapen what should
be an endless pursuit of perfection

285
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:03,105
just because you want the world
to laugh with you tonight.

286
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,693
Now, call it.

287
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:07,640
Time of death, 11.55.

288
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,506
Good girl.

289
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:13,275
Better go get
yourself a cup of coffee.

290
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,830
New game starts in four minutes.

291
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:25,257
Hey, Carla.

292
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,880
Carla, wait!

293
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:29,426
Where are you going?

294
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,567
I'm gonna go crash at my place
tonight, like you said.

295
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:35,095
You want to know?
That's what's wrong.

296
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:38,008
''I'm gonna go chill out
at my house, like you said.''

297
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,164
God, you're so se<i>xy</i> right now.

298
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:43,772
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
And, you know...

299
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,918
We're past that new,
exciting relationship phase,

300
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,965
and all that's left is us.

301
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,570
Baby, I gotta tell you,
you drive me crazy.

302
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:55,837
You take my French fries, you boss
me around in front of my friends.

303
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:58,456
You said strong women turn you on.

304
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:03,924
We know what you're gonna do,
so why not do it so I can go home?

305
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:05,223
OK.

306
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,660
I love you.

307
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:17,084
You annoy me more than
I ever thought possible,

308
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,440
but I want to spend every
irritating minute with you.

309
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:24,925
Me too.

310
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,681
Yeah?

311
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,082
I love you.

312
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,789
I don't get it.
Why are you doing this to me?

313
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:40,013
All I wanted to do was have sex
with a fo<i>xy</i> nurse, and now I'm in love?

314
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,148
Sweetie, that happens.

315
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:49,939
<i>I've been thinking lately</i>
<i>about taking chances...</i>

316
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:53,272
Run a tox screen and
a full blood workup for the guy in 37.

317
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,005
You can handle that?

318
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,559
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

319
00:20:56,704 --> 00:21:00,936
Up on the second floor... There's a
laundry list of stuff I want you to do.

320
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,006
<i>...and how it's just</i>
<i>about overcoming your fears.</i>

321
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,123
<i>Because every time</i>
<i>you take a big risk in your life,</i>

322
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,809
<i>no matter how it ends up,</i>
<i>you're always glad you took it.</i>

323
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:15,294
Wait! Stop the machine.

324
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:19,067
- What the hell are you doing?
- Will you go out with me?

325
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,743
If I say no, will you
let me out of this thing?

326
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:24,326
- It's iffy.
- Then I guess I have to say yes.

327
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:27,959
- So say it.
- Sure. I'd love to.

328
