1
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,795
<i>The human brain is remarkable.</i>

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,362
<i>For nine years</i>
<i>I thought I'd lost my watch</i>

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,753
<i>cos I can't remember</i>
<i>which wrist it's on.</i>

4
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,847
<i>And yet, after two weeks,</i>

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:18,653
<i>the things that scared me at first,</i>
<i>catheters, chest tubes, IVs...</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,341
<i>Everything has started to click.</i>

7
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:29,097
Are you?
If you have time to listen to music,

8
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:33,341
then I assume you have time
to finish your paperwork.

9
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,267
Keep moving.

10
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,355
<i>That work day</i>
<i>started like every other.</i>

11
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:16,047
- How's it goin'?
- I'm a 37-year-old janitor.

12
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,710
How d'you think it's going?

13
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,414
There is nothing wrong
with being a janitor.

14
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:25,078
Really? Thank you,
you've turned my life around.

15
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:29,833
I'll tell my janitor wife and all our
janitor kids that life is worth living.

16
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:34,668
And that comes straight from our hero,
Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.

17
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,468
No, seriously, come on.

18
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,741
Come over to my humble house and
point out things that are cheap.

19
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,756
<i>Luckily, I had the night off to regroup.</i>

20
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,967
- That dog is creepy.
- Be nice to Rowdy.

21
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,690
The guy we bought him from kept
him in a box full of old hats.

22
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,884
Why is she here all the time?

23
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:03,533
- Just give her a chance, man.
- You want to hit that.

24
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,250
- No!
- Yeah!

25
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,200
She's just a friend.

26
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:13,240
It's healthy, hanging out with a girl
without the ultimate goal being sex.

27
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,811
- You know?
- I'm not following.

28
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,745
Creepy. I had a run-in
with that nurse, Carla.

29
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,351
She forgot to check the stats
on a patient and gave me attitude.

30
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,308
Did you tell on her?

31
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:31,937
- Who's responsible for this?
- She is.

32
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:37,101
I don't remember.
Why do you assume it was my fault?

33
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,627
<i>It'd be a good point, except Elliot</i>
<i>puts her foot in her mouth.</i>

34
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,652
<i>A lot.</i>
<i>She can't really seem to stop.</i>

35
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,372
Just because I occasionally
say something stupid doesn't mean

36
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:52,844
I go door-to-door annoying people,
like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.

37
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:55,770
- You're not?
- No.

38
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:58,569
My mother is.

39
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:03,532
He's black, too.
You should tease him about that.

40
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:07,791
<i>I'm doing better with new people.</i>
<i>Like Carla, for instance.</i>

41
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,199
Bambi, that blonde stick
you hang out with? Tell her...

42
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,161
You might have to
write that down for me.

43
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,025
<i>And Dr Cox. We've really connected.</i>
<i>I'm kind of like his protégé.</i>

44
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,785
- I need to see his chart...
- Done, copied and highlighted.

45
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:29,858
Unfortunately, radar,
I'm fresh out of gold stars.

46
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,896
Multilobar pneumonia at 31.
How much does he smoke?

47
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:35,788
I don't know.

48
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,943
It's your attention to detail
that impresses me most.

49
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,156
- How many packs a day, genius?
- Half a pack.

50
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:47,288
I'm sorry.
I phrased the question wrong.

51
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,859
How many packs a day, really?

52
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,959
Eleven.

53
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,250
You don't know where I'm coming from.

54
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,578
Two or three packs.

55
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:59,269
Let's hear it.

56
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,867
I don't smoke so... Zero packs.

57
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:06,485
What tests have you ordered?

58
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:09,526
I was just...
I was totally kidding with you.

59
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,851
He was. We're all in on it.

60
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,578
<i>I like Will. That makes this harder.</i>

61
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,975
I ordered blood cultures
and a high-resolution CT.

62
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,796
What are you looking for?

63
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:24,867
Cancer.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,549
<i>When you say ''cancer, ''</i>
<i>every person reacts the same way.</i>

65
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,309
- Excellent.
- <i>Not like that.</i>

66
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:34,861
<i>There it is.</i>

67
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:40,341
<i>I never know what to say to</i>
<i>Turk's buddies. But I'm getting better.</i>

68
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,317
So...

69
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,149
- How's surgery?
- It rocks.

70
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:49,950
But my bedroom, that's where
I really operate. Am I right?

71
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,987
- Come on, show Todd some love!
- <i>I hate showing Todd love.</i>

72
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:59,398
Bambi, why are you slumming
with these scalpel jocks?

73
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:02,690
Please, baby.
This here's the VIP table.

74
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,276
Why don't you
sit your fine self down?

75
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,907
''Baby, this here's the VIP table...''

76
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,439
I'm not really interested in her.

77
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:19,388
Then the Todd'll show
that little biscuit some love.

78
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,382
<i>Maybe he's a bit interested.</i>

79
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,916
Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.

80
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,811
I'm going to ask Carla out.

81
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:37,865
- I think the janitor's out to get me.
- Thank you so much for your help.

82
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,106
Why not be a bit more paranoid?

83
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:43,036
- Wait, Turk...
- That's him.

84
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,078
Hi, how are you?

85
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:55,921
I need David Farr's chart.

86
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,488
We all need lots of things.

87
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:01,635
Great. Dr Kelso?
You're the Chief of Medicine.

88
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:05,396
Is there a special way
to communicate with nursing staff?

89
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:09,635
Sugar won't work.
They're already so sweet.

90
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,439
Now, listen,
Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,

91
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,006
you tattled yesterday, I responded.

92
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:20,824
I feel closer to you than ever.
But the ramifications are yours.

93
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:25,192
Don't drag me into your pathetic,
whiny, little squabble

94
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:29,003
with that bunch of malcontents.
I hope you all kill each other.

95
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,285
Have a great day, ladies.

96
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:37,534
I hate this place.

97
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,674
Dr Cox, I got Will's CT results back.

98
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:43,684
No cancer.
So what shall I tell him?

99
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,447
I'd open with that.

100
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,114
He's headed down such a bad road,
maybe we could talk to him...

101
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:53,312
<i>When you have a mentor, you understand</i>
<i>the meaning behind their words.</i>

102
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:56,875
- You do whatever you want.
- <i>Means ''Great idea''.</i>

103
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,988
I'm just happy
you haven't messed up yet today.

104
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:03,030
<i>Means ''You're really</i>
<i>coming along as a doctor''.</i>

105
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,996
- Don't ever touch me.
- <i>Means ''Don't ever touch him''.</i>

106
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,280
Just thought it was a nice moment.

107
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,869
- I don't wanna.
- Come on.

108
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:23,509
Carla, I shouldn't have
told Dr Kelso on you.

109
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,151
No, you shouldn't have.

110
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,847
<i>Comfortable silences.</i>

111
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:33,215
But thank you for apologising.

112
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,229
Good.

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,517
- I wanna make one thing clear.
- Nothing needs to be clear.

114
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,092
I still think you were in the wrong.

115
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:47,832
Checking orthostatics is your job.
I need to know you'll take care of it.

116
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,445
That's all I'm saying.

117
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,138
There. All better.

118
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,685
As of now,
you have no signs of cancer.

119
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,199
Who rules? Will rules.

120
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:05,740
This isn't great news.

121
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,648
Are you sure?
That's how it first hit me.

122
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,840
You're on a slippery slope.

123
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,737
<i>I had to scare him but</i>
<i>I sensed he'd heard it before.</i>

124
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:17,088
<i>Part of being a doctor</i>
<i>is your ability to improvise.</i>

125
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:20,513
Right now, the one thing
I want you to think about...

126
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:25,422
<i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>

127
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,648
Let me see.

128
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:33,040
- <i>This is so cool.</i>
- No, it's not.

129
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:36,445
- <i>Biddy, biddy, biddy.</i>
- It's not a toy.

130
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,270
<i>Would you like to play a game?</i>

131
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,898
<i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>if all you have is old words,</i>

132
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:46,163
<i>all you can do is</i>
<i>hope they say something new.</i>

133
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,503
Look, man. You're a great patient.

134
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,157
I like you enough
to hope I never see you again.

135
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,070
But if you keep smoking,
you'll be back here.

136
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,846
I bet my own life on that.

137
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:08,163
<i>Dr Reid to Room 402, then down</i>
<i>to 201, then back up to Room 403.</i>

138
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,866
I'm nervous, man.

139
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,604
I'm your wing man.
I will not leave your side.

140
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:24,470
- Hey, baby.
- Keep moving, frat boy.

141
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:30,442
- Come on. Out with it.
- Don't rush me.

142
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,360
I mean...

143
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:36,668
You shouldn't be impatient
with the opportunity of a lifetime.

144
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:43,379
I'm gonna sit down because
you're so se<i>xy</i>? My knees are weak.

145
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:45,999
Really?

146
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,145
Dr Cox?
I know I'm being annoying,

147
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:50,678
but I'm getting used
to talking to patients.

148
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,620
This is why I became a doctor, right?

149
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:57,219
I heard, ''I know I'm being
annoying'' and then white noise.

150
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,096
Will, I got him to quit smoking.

151
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,729
For ever? No last one?
The last ones are better than sex.

152
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,955
Trust me, I've had 1,000 of them.

153
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,126
Done forever, he swore to me.
I reached him. I reached him.

154
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,869
You're having a big day, there, Susan.

155
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,933
Private party.

156
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:35,238
<i>Gotta get right back on the horse.</i>

157
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,445
- Dr Cox, about Will.
- Not now!

158
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,341
I've a 10-minute break
and my soap is on.

159
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:45,164
Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead
and change the channels,

160
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,573
I swear I'll suture
your hands together.

161
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,951
- Right. So with Will...
- This woman is just fantastic.

162
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,775
The breasts are probably fake
but by God, those tears are real.

163
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,493
<i>Time for a bold move.</i>

164
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,459
How are we gonna fix this Will thing?

165
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:10,531
Do you know what you've just done?

166
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,094
You just lost all lapdog privileges.

167
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:16,400
- Excuse me?
- No more walkies, no more treats,

168
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,770
no more following me around.

169
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,423
- I'm not your lapdog.
- You back there.

170
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,822
What do we do with lapdogs
who can't behave in the house?

171
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,036
Make them stay outside?

172
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,774
You have five seconds
to get out of this room,

173
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:33,243
or I'm gonna start whacking you
on the nose with this.

174
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,984
Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.

175
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,570
- But I was thinking...
- Go!

176
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,221
What do you want to watch?

177
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,118
- <i>Days of our Lives?</i>
- Attaboy.

178
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,561
Come in.

179
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,650
He smells the food.

180
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,153
Move your butt.

181
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:03,982
Peace offering?

182
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:09,450
I know I don't always
make the best first impression.

183
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,751
Or second, for that matter.

184
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:17,189
I'd like us to be friends. I thought
I could get to know you a bit better.

185
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,781
See what you're about.

186
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:24,221
For instance,
when did you meet Morgan Freeman?

187
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,633
That's my mom.

188
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,255
I like her freckles.

189
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,372
Rowdy, no!

190
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:40,029
I can't figure out why
Dr Cox tore me a new one today.

191
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,805
Enough already! He's a jerk.

192
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:45,512
- He's a jerk.
- He's a jerk.

193
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,223
- He's a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

194
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,457
He's just Dr Cox.
He's always like that.

195
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:54,392
Who really knows him?
Who does he hang out with?

196
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,061
- No one.
- <i>That must be lonely.</i>

197
00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:00,857
''Take two Turks as needed,
apply to sensitive areas...''

198
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,090
Who wrote this?

199
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:04,462
Whassup?

200
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,706
Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason
why you won't go out with me.

201
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,058
You're a surgeon,
so you got the God complex,

202
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,476
the ''married to the job'' thing.

203
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,934
You're cute,
but you're very aware of it.

204
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:25,271
You've no idea what I'm like, so your
feelings for me come from down there.

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,532
But most of all,
I'm looking for the real thing.

206
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:33,030
You're nothing but a little boy
who's not used to being told ''No''.

207
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:37,291
So there's a bunch of reasons.
Pick your favourite.

208
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,225
I'd go with the God complex.

209
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,388
But it's hard to choose.
They're all so good.

210
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,795
<i>A hospital is a tricky place.</i>

211
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,856
<i>It's very cliquey</i>
<i>and you have to watch what you say.</i>

212
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,941
<i>It's a lot like high school.</i>

213
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,956
<i>If I didn't have</i>
<i>somewhere else to be,</i>

214
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,443
<i>I would have gone</i>
<i>and sat with her.</i>

215
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:25,472
<i>But tonight, there's somebody</i>
<i>else I have to take care of.</i>

216
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:34,564
I know watching Will
kill himself hurts you, too.

217
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:37,165
It's harder if you have
no one to talk with.

218
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:41,071
So I figured I'd pick up
a few cold ones, right?

219
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:45,238
And you and I, we'll talk it out,
we'll just break the whole thing down.

220
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:48,248
Right? What do you say to that?

221
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:55,791
Everyone keeps ignoring me.
I'm like a plague around here.

222
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:58,164
Don't look at me
when you're talking.

223
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:02,813
Dr Reid. I just wanted to say,
you're out of my doghouse.

224
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,691
That was a great catch
on that patient with meningococcus.

225
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,528
That actually wasn't me.
Carla noticed the rash on his legs.

226
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:14,161
You could have been
back into my good graces

227
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,197
and instead you passed
the credit on to a nurse.

228
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:22,157
How noble. I tell you what,
I'll get the cafeteria staff to write

229
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,963
''Was it worth it?''
on a big cake for you.

230
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,754
''...station''.
This is the nurses' station.

231
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:38,640
- Do you think I've damaged ligaments?
- I don't care.

232
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:42,837
Now, can I count on you
to never drop by here again?

233
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,086
Or shall I just move?

234
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:48,619
You can't leave a place
with this much warmth.

235
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,321
I especially love this shelf filled with
photos of your friends and family.

236
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,993
<i>If he comes at you,</i>
<i>just try and roll out the door.</i>

237
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,193
Actually, you have a point.

238
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,670
I guess watching the game
by yourself with a Scotch

239
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:09,424
isn't really the only way
to watch a game.

240
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:16,686
It's just that... I've always thought
of needing people as a sign of weakness.

241
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,764
- It's not.
- Well, then...

242
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:23,196
Would you stay and
watch the game with me?

243
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,657
Maybe have a slice of pizza?

244
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,937
- Of course I will.
- I can braid your hair.

245
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:35,686
I know the couch isn't very deep,
but we could move the back cushion

246
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,930
and spoon.

247
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,795
Hey, you guys, what do you say?
Beer and chips in the back.

248
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,100
Just ignore them.

249
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,477
Tell me the answer to this question.

250
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:51,049
Do you want to be the big spoon
or the little spoon?

251
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:55,417
Kelso didn't ask her,
she gave you full credit.

252
00:17:55,625 --> 00:18:00,255
I don't care. Too little too late.
Plus, I know why you're really here.

253
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:04,096
So I'm gonna plop myself
right here in the VIP section,

254
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:07,255
so you can give me what you got.

255
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,622
I was gonna tell you
how I busted JD's chops the other day

256
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,999
for wanting to be friends with a girl.

257
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:16,336
And now I find it so amazing
to see how strong you are,

258
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,554
how well you carry yourself,

259
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:22,964
how I'd give anything to wake up
and watch you read the paper.

260
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,194
But instead I think you should
hop off your broom,

261
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,478
remember what it was like
when you first started here

262
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:35,412
and give Elliot a break. Because she may
be a chore but she is a good person.

263
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:41,149
And your ass is especially fine today.

264
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,338
Pick me up tomorrow at seven.

265
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:48,701
She's not the only one
who can do a speech. I can do a speech.

266
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:53,567
Return that umbrella to me at
the hospital. Not here. Is that clear?

267
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,210
And, Newbie...

268
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,035
- Know what your problem is?
- My bones hurt?

269
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:04,669
You were gonna rescue me from loneliness
with a $3 six-pack of light beer?

270
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:09,302
It turns out we can't
save people from themselves.

271
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:13,162
We just treat 'em. Treat that kid
with a respiratory problem

272
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:16,722
and when he comes back with cancer,
go ahead and treat that.

273
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:20,427
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

274
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,184
Smokers, drinkers, druggies,
fatties, whatever.

275
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:29,816
If you keep living and dying on whether
or not a person changes, well...

276
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,277
You're not gonna make it as a doctor.

277
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:41,539
Now come here and give me a hug.
It's OK, come here.

278
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,466
Get outta here!

279
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,602
Take this piss water with you.
It's embarrassing.

280
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:53,418
- I'll drink it!
- I'll take the beer. You'll beat it.

281
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:55,818
- You apologise.
- No, I don't wanna.

282
00:19:55,996 --> 00:20:00,512
OK, come on. Just do it really fast.
Like a Band-Aid.

283
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,751
I wrote out the pharmacy renewals
on all your patients.

284
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,680
Great. You know what else
would be helpful?

285
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,828
<i>The one thing we never</i>
<i>stop looking for is acceptance.</i>

286
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:16,286
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.

287
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:18,830
<i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings.</i>

288
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,011
- So when's the baby due?
- What baby?

289
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,779
<i>Acceptance that some things</i>
<i>are gonna be what they're gonna be.</i>

290
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,496
This is a strange resort.
The wheelchair service is great

291
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,855
but that suite I rented,
there was another person in it.

292
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:36,909
- And the bellhop gave me an enema.
- Yeah, he's new here.

293
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,300
So...

294
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:46,452
- Anything you wanna say?
- You know it all, man.

295
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:49,914
<i>Still, I hated Will a little</i>

296
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,765
<i>cos I looked at people</i>
<i>who are important to me</i>

297
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,165
<i>in terms of what</i>
<i>will probably kill them.</i>

298
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,383
<i>Heart disease.</i>

299
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,673
<i>Liver disease.</i>

300
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,046
<i>Somebody choking her.</i>

301
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,846
<i>I don't know.</i>

302
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:08,015
<i>Probably stress.</i>

303
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,595
- Say anything else to him?
- No.

304
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:17,775
But you wanted to.

305
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,751
- You told me not to.
- Would you be a man?

306
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:24,631
Stick to your convictions
or you'll never make it as a doctor.

307
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,282
I can't believe your head exploded.

308
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,106
If it does,
you'll never make it as a doctor.

309
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:37,613
I mean, come on.
You look ridiculous.

310
