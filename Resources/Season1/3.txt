1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:04,635
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I came to watch Turk</i>

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,945
<i>when I could've been asleep.</i>

3
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:09,557
<i>I guess I haven't seen</i>
<i>much of him lately.</i>

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,139
<i>It's not like I'm desperate.</i>

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,677
What makes you think you know better?

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:23,480
- In my gut I know I'm right.
- We need this decision now.

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,655
- Fine, then it's on you.
- Yes, it is.

8
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,444
Nurse.

9
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:31,719
- Erasure.
- Yes, doctor.

10
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:52,562
I hate this song.

11
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,452
Me too, man.

12
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:17,777
<i>A hospital room can be</i>
<i>kind of a romantic place.</i>

13
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:20,621
<i>Maybe it's the soft green glow</i>
<i>of a heart monitor,</i>

14
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,460
<i>or the way the moonlight</i>
<i>reflects off a bedpan.</i>

15
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,694
Our shifts keep overlapping
on Friday nights.

16
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:29,379
Closest thing
I've had to a date recently.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,855
Well, I had
a great time tonight.

18
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,111
Oh, yeah. Me too.

19
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:38,650
- So, can I page you?
- Don't do the two-day waiting thing.

20
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,879
Oh, baby,
I don't play by the rules.

21
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,325
So, goodnight.

22
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:46,867
<i>Wait. Is she joking?</i>
<i>If she's joking and I kiss her...</i>

23
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,704
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if she's not joking...</i>

24
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:11,266
I don't do this
for all the doctors.

25
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,411
<i>Yes!</i>

26
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,973
He's gonna need 40mEqs of KCL.

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,320
Grab me when you get the results.

28
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,178
You got it.

29
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:26,414
His TV is broken, so when you
two start tagging each other,

30
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,637
the least you can do is
wake him up and let him watch.

31
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,872
<i>In my experience, when two friends</i>
<i>miss a chance like this,</i>

32
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,663
<i>you've got exactly 48 hours</i>
<i>to get the kiss.</i>

33
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,485
<i>Or one of you will over-think it.</i>
<i>OK, she's gonna over-think it.</i>

34
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:44,250
<i>Then you end up permanently</i>
<i>stuck in the Friend Zone.</i>

35
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:46,835
I'll see ya.

36
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,156
You're such a girl.

37
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:55,465
Nothing went on between me and Elliot.

38
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,896
Good thing you still
have your flower.

39
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,679
That song is like a virus.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,598
I'm just a little lonely.

41
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:06,432
I haven't been hanging out with Turk
since he's been dating Carla.

42
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,554
First of all, who's Turk?

43
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,952
And don't answer.
Look, if you have a medical question,

44
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:14,856
I'm forced by hospital policy
to answer you.

45
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,053
However, if you ask me
about a personal problem,

46
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,866
I'm going to start doing this.

47
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,887
You seem unhappy.

48
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,984
I like that.

49
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:43,604
I cannot get that stupid song
out of my head.

50
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:47,354
It's like a damn virus.
Here's his chart, his transfer note.

51
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:51,188
He's haemodynamically stable.
Consider him turfed to medicine.

52
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,307
T-Man. I'm gonna get my grub on.

53
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:58,548
Means he's gonna go eat.

54
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,569
- Surgery went OK?
- It was cool.

55
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:07,970
Dude, I got to close
for the first time ever. Ever.

56
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,469
The human body is so disgusting.

57
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,725
Not yours. Yours is stunning.

58
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:17,870
We should celebrate. Tear it up
like we used to, just the two of us.

59
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,276
- What comes before Part B?
- Part A!

60
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,105
That's right, we used to tear it up.

61
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,447
We should probably
never do that again.

62
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:36,510
<i>That song is like a virus.</i>

63
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,718
No!

64
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,215
<i>Don't let it be awkward.</i>

65
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:50,682
<i>Do something cute.</i>

66
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,814
<i>Cover her eyes</i>
<i>and say, ''Guess who?''</i>

67
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,856
- Guess who?
- I can't breathe.

68
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,429
OK, gang, it's time for rounds.

69
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:05,216
Let's see who's
<i>The Weakest Link.</i>

70
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,332
The Weakest Link!

71
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:17,949
Now, then, Dr Simotas.

72
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:22,503
Severe swelling of the lips in this
patient might be an indication of what?

73
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,570
- Angio-oedema.
- Well done, sport.

74
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:29,290
And what treatment would you
recommend, Dr Dorian?

75
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,759
A combination of steroids
and antihistamines.

76
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,458
Attaboy, sport.

77
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,651
What would you recommend
the patient stay away from,

78
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,305
Dr Reid?

79
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:45,970
- My first guess would be shellfish.
- Right you are, sweetheart.

80
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,242
Sweetheart?

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,213
<i>I could see what was going on</i>
<i>in Elliot's head.</i>

82
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:54,008
Right you are, sweetheart.

83
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,114
- What do you want to watch?
- <i>Fletch.</i>

84
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,225
- <i>Fletch</i> it is.
- Seen it.

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,392
You haven't seen it with us
saying all the lines.

86
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,250
I'm so lucky I met you.

87
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,517
Maybe next time
her mom could come.

88
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,055
You won't even know she's here.

89
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,714
Except she laughs at stupid stuff
and that makes me laugh.

90
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:26,108
It's stupid because it's so stupid.

91
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:29,847
- Tonight's still about us.
- Whatever, I don't care.

92
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,683
Turk, you wanna go hang out
in your room?

93
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,263
I know Dr Kelso
doesn't mean anything by it,

94
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:42,749
and OK, maybe I am
kind of a sweetheart.

95
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,972
- I'm sleeping.
- But it just sounds so demeaning.

96
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,907
You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

97
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,861
It's not like
he's my grandpa or anything.

98
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,141
Anyway, JD always tells me
how much you've helped him.

99
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:58,720
He obviously hasn't told you
about my ear-flicking policy.

100
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,182
This whole groovy
guidance counsellor thing

101
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,723
you people seem to have working
is a total fantasy.

102
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,426
I'm not that guy.
You can go and ask anybody.

103
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:12,097
Now, you've got to leave me
alone or I'll punish you.

104
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,170
Sweetheart is kind of innocuous.

105
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,981
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go down there and confront Kelso.

106
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,702
- Really?
- Absolutely.

107
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,160
Never mind
that he is the Chief of Medicine,

108
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,114
he'll have a whole new level
of respect for you.

109
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,794
- Honestly?
- Yes.

110
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:35,173
You can't have sexist terms
like that around here. You go get 'im.

111
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,913
This guy looks stable
but I still wanna get an EKG.

112
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,839
Let's do cardiac enzymes...

113
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,829
When you say sweetheart...

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,070
...and an aspirin.

115
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,641
<i>A lot of my work</i>
<i>has become second nature.</i>

116
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,306
<i>But it gives me too much time to think.</i>

117
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,227
Look, I'm surgery and you're medicine.

118
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:02,022
This isn't college any more.
Things have to change.

119
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:07,054
I know relationships change, I guess
I thought yours and mine never would.

120
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,107
- What's going on with you, man?
- We used to look out for each other.

121
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,427
I don't feel you have my back any more.

122
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,885
- You really feel that way?
- Yeah, I do.

123
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,308
You do? Great.

124
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,880
I'll get them from my locker,
you can write me a cheque.

125
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:27,112
Can you look at Mr Bidwell?
His temperature's starting to spike.

126
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,848
Sure.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,991
Legally, there's a huge difference.

128
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,525
Stitch a patient, sew a sheet to him,
that's an accident.

129
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:39,271
He tries getting up, gurney collapses,
breaks his front teeth,

130
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,704
that's a lawsuit.

131
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:43,564
Say it with me.
Accident. Lawsuit.

132
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:45,322
Accident. Lawsuit.

133
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,193
So, what is it, sweetheart?

134
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,227
It's the sweetheart thing.
It doesn't hit me right.

135
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:54,397
I'm a doctor,
it seems sort of disrespectful.

136
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:58,123
I've always called men ''sport''
and ladies ''sweetheart''.

137
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,671
But you call Becky ''sport''.

138
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:08,831
Well, I am so sorry, sport.

139
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:11,762
It's one of those bad habits
I've developed

140
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,315
after working in the medical field
for over 30 years.

141
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:19,824
30 years? But you look so young!

142
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,617
<i>It's hard to see a patient</i>
<i>get worse instead of better.</i>

143
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,840
<i>That's kind of the opposite</i>
<i>of what we're going for.</i>

144
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,096
He was fine last night.

145
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,058
Now he's diaphoretic, in and out
of consciousness, maybe septic.

146
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,671
We won't know till
his blood work's back.

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,738
<i>If he's septic, they might</i>
<i>have to re-open this guy.</i>

148
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:43,619
<i>Course, there's also</i>
<i>a chance he could die.</i>

149
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,463
I've seen this before.
Gauze, sponges,

150
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,379
some young surgeon
left something in this man.

151
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,017
No, I know the guy that closed.
He'd never be that careless.

152
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,249
Excuse me, sorry.

153
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,251
Has anyone seen my keys?

154
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:01,380
No? How about my wallet?

155
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:03,583
Anyone?

156
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,655
I've never seen that before.

157
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,644
Turk!

158
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:30,299
Dr Cox, have you seen Turk?

159
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,831
Turk.

160
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:48,898
I was just dreaming about you.

161
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,371
You were... Well, we were...

162
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,593
You got a few minutes?

163
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,794
Don't move.

164
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,178
No. Don't move.

165
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:07,162
- Have you seen Turk?
- Yeah, I saw him.

166
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,603
He just went out that door.

167
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,940
Turk?

168
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,585
Can't hear you.

169
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,056
- What?
- Let me in!

170
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,141
You love who?

171
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,043
Mr Kavanaugh,
your arrhythmia's much better.

172
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,796
Everything looks just great, actually.

173
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,916
You sound surprised.

174
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:51,948
It has nothing to do with you.

175
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:55,191
I had a run-in with Dr Kelso,
so when he switched me to you,

176
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,928
I thought it would be a difficult case.

177
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,549
Go on, I'm listening.

178
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:05,261
Excuse me while I check
on another penis... patient.

179
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,500
Well, he's a penis patient.

180
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,704
Turk!

181
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:14,361
No, I gotta talk to you.

182
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,666
No!

183
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,439
It's nine up, OK? We just
lost our fourth, it's your ball.

184
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,121
It's important.

185
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:25,471
This is not a joke either. This is real.
It's surgical versus medical.

186
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,170
- Your ball, you're shirts.
- Let's play.

187
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:31,561
<i>There it was. Everything was</i>
<i>more important than me now.</i>

188
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,344
Don't bring in the same crap
the last kid did.

189
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,050
<i>Suddenly, I was so fed up</i>

190
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,561
<i>I decided to teach Turk</i>
<i>and Todd a lesson on the court.</i>

191
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,442
<i>You know, once I warm up a little.</i>

192
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,190
JD, I'm gonna show you...

193
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:01,992
what the deal...
Oh, oh...

194
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:05,545
- Throw the body out of him!
- Oh!

195
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,532
All right, that's game.
What's so important?

196
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,575
I was looking at Bidwell...

197
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,782
One second.

198
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:23,844
I gotta go.
But you played a good game.

199
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,122
I thought you sucked.

200
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,653
Go get your grub on.

201
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,628
- Hey, baby.
- You gotta be kidding.

202
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,256
Yes?

203
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:47,834
- Sorry to bother you, sir.
- Well, if it isn't ''sport''.

204
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:52,350
How are things?
Did you see Mr Kavanaugh today?

205
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,207
Yes.

206
00:13:55,701 --> 00:14:00,013
Yes, I did. Dr Kelso,
I just wanted to say, well,

207
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,918
as far as the sweetheart thing goes,
maybe I overreacted.

208
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:08,764
Are you sure? I wouldn't want you
to be the least bit uncomfortable.

209
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:14,076
I have no idea what possessed me
to say anything in the first place.

210
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,584
You've got to leave me alone
or I'll punish you.

211
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:21,516
- Absolutely no idea.
- Super.

212
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,522
Then run along, sweetheart.

213
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,014
Have you seen
Mr Bidwell's blood work?

214
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:49,042
No, it hasn't come back yet.

215
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,967
- OK, have you seen Turk?
- Not since this morning.

216
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,731
I'm sure you'll see him
before I do, so...

217
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,920
Bambi, are you giving me attitude?

218
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,859
What if I am?

219
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,611
You have to be a minority sidekick
in a bad movie to pull that off.

220
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:11,254
- You know what I mean, right?
- Child, you speak the truth!

221
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,555
Explain it to him.

222
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:17,333
You do the hand, then the finger,
then talk through the nose.

223
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:21,932
Then give a lot of attitude. If you're
not from there, you don't understand...

224
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,479
- OK, I'm gonna leave now.
- What?

225
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:27,816
Oh, no, you didn't! Where you going?
Where you going?

226
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,407
Thank you very much.

227
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,841
- What?
- Hi, how are you?

228
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,780
I have a quick legal question.
I'm just curious.

229
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,503
- What if, hypothetically...
- Oh, God! You killed somebody.

230
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,095
- No!
- Someone else did.

231
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:05,202
- No, no one killed anyone.
- Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.

232
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,447
I'm not sure there is a problem.

233
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,093
I'm running tests,
doing everything I should.

234
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:13,889
If you know something, by not
reporting it you're as culpable.

235
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:16,122
Anything you wanna tell me?

236
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,815
<i>Why am I protecting Turk</i>
<i>when he can't give me five seconds?</i>

237
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:22,727
- Anything at all?
- <i>Tell him.</i>

238
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,490
No.

239
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:29,704
Scared the hell out of me.

240
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,269
Dr Cox...

241
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,641
I'm hoping there's another
Dr Cox sat behind me.

242
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,387
Sending me to Kelso like that, I'm not
sure what you were trying to teach me.

243
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:54,547
The value, and this is important,
of leaving me alone.

244
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:58,187
- There's more to it than that.
- No, there's not.

245
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:01,975
Look, I want you to go ahead
and spread the word.

246
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,894
I've had enough.

247
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,887
The next whiny intern that comes
to me for a cookie and a hug,

248
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:11,659
I swear to Aisha,
I'm going to hurt them.

249
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,051
And you, you one-woman freak show,

250
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,464
take your blah-blah
to the blah-blah-ologist.

251
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:21,483
If you're so stupid as to
confront the Chief of Medicine,

252
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,050
over some
quasi-offensive endearment,

253
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,519
then you've got to replace
the captain of your brain ship

254
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,419
because he's drunk.

255
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,416
You're right. I need to learn to
pick my battles. Thank you, sir.

256
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,324
You're welcome.

257
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,203
And you say your husband
hardly wore them?

258
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:43,615
Fantastic.

259
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,113
The blood work came back.

260
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,051
Negative?

261
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,662
But the guy looks like death.

262
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,926
Hi!

263
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,099
What happened?

264
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:03,499
There's no infection. He's diabetic.
So when someone gave him insulin,

265
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,820
when he wasn't eating,
he became hypoglycaemic.

266
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:10,187
The only person
that could've given him insulin...

267
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:12,780
Me!

268
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,276
I gave him insulin.
<i>Twice.</i>

269
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,853
He's fine, Bambi. I gave him
an amp of D50 and he's eating now.

270
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,569
You should probably give him
some orange juice in an hour.

271
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:28,956
- Thank you so much. You saved my ass.
- No, it wasn't me.

272
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,702
- Look, Turk.
- Come on, man. I always got your back.

273
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,738
I know.

274
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,779
<i>Tell him how you feel</i>
<i>without sounding like a girl.</i>

275
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,979
I miss you so much
it hurts sometimes.

276
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,116
OK...

277
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,044
- I'm gonna let that go for now.
- Thank you.

278
00:18:57,294 --> 00:19:00,730
We'll find time to hang, man.
We're both swamped right now

279
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,433
and I'm hanging out
with Carla a lot.

280
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:07,070
But if there was someone you were into
you'd be doing the same.

281
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,022
<i>Crap!</i>

282
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,740
Did Nurse Roberts
sell you these?

283
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:58,622
- You don't wanna hear about my day.
- You're right. Kiss me.

284
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,617
- Right now?
- We can wait three, four seconds.

285
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:07,210
- But I just ate, I feel gross.
- Not gross, pretty. Come here.

286
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,567
JD, can we just talk for a second?

287
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,542
<i>It never fails.</i>

288
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:31,461
Oh, yeah, another one.

289
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,197
How're you doing?

290
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,738
Went to high school with her.

291
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,926
We worked at Penguins Yoghurt.

292
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:42,017
- I met her on a bus.
- She'll come around.

293
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,504
Pretzel?

294
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,013
Thank you.

295
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:50,669
The first few weeks have been so hard,
mentally, physically, emotionally.

296
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,145
It's like math camp all over again.

297
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:56,046
Not that I've been to math camp,
it's an expression.

298
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,203
I use it all the time.

299
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,285
- Come on.
- Anyway...

300
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,135
<i>Choosing friendship over sex is</i>
<i>the last thing any guy wants to hear,</i>

301
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:07,414
<i>but you know what?</i>

302
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:10,310
<i>This time, it actually</i>
<i>made sense to me.</i>

303
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:13,867
<i>Besides, I challenge anyone</i>
<i>to survive being an intern</i>

304
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:17,329
<i>without having a close</i>
<i>group of friends to lean on.</i>

305
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,523
I can't believe
you lost our bottle opener.

306
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:24,723
Yeah, I know.

307
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,169
I miss it so much
it hurts sometimes.

308
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,564
- You're a bad person.
- Don't judge me.
