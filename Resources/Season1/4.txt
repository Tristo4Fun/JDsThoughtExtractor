1
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:03,129
- Just let it go?
- No.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,136
Why wouldn't
I wanna go to the symphony?

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:09,385
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- You meant something.

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,434
- We've got to do something.
- No, we really don't.

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,524
Carla's your girlfriend,
Elliot's my friend...

6
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,882
Trust me. Don't get involved.

7
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,741
She's from <i>el barrio,</i>
she must not like music.

8
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:25,542
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, I didn't have a nanny...

9
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:30,239
You got something to say?

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,521
I think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.

11
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,928
Excuse me for a second,
just one second.

12
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,584
She's from <i>el barrio,</i>
she won't like music.

13
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:05,089
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, I didn't have a nanny...

14
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,070
You got something to say?

15
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,758
<i>Nope. Not this time.</i>

16
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:17,268
I think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.

17
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,353
Dammit!

18
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,607
<i>Here's something surprising.</i>

19
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:52,015
<i>On my first day,</i>
<i>my resident told me,</i>

20
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:56,243
<i>if you don't count the maternity ward,</i>
<i>which is mostly well, you know,</i>

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,491
<i>or the emergency room,</i>

22
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:01,979
<i>which is mostly broken bones,</i>
<i>stitches, that sort of thing,</i>

23
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:05,729
<i>he said that</i>
<i>one out of every three patients</i>

24
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,244
<i>that's admitted to this place</i>
<i>will die here.</i>

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,789
Hi, I'm gonna be your doctor.

26
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:15,330
I'm the doctor.

27
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,654
I'm the doctor.

28
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,930
- What are you, 16?
- Unacceptable.

29
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,303
Did you have coupons for this hospital?

30
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,123
That's enough!

31
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,033
Sure, he's young but he's
probably a very good doctor.

32
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,400
- Are you a good doctor?
- Kinda too soon to tell.

33
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,974
Honesty, I like that.

34
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,802
You probably want
these people to wait outside.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,115
That'd be nice.

36
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,560
Make 'em know
you're a man, not a boy.

37
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,744
Would you guys mind...

38
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:47,358
- I'm fine where I am, thank you.
- Make me.

39
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:48,992
Do it.

40
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,127
Everybody outta here, now!

41
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,536
- No need to wake up the dead.
- Jeez, snippy.

42
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,996
- Now!
- That was manly.

43
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,699
That's what I'm talking about.

44
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,286
- Want a hard candy?
- Yes, please.

45
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:07,223
I'd say this is a simple
laparoscopic hernia repair.

46
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:11,041
This is embarrassing, you guys
are wearing the same outfit.

47
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,797
Don't sweat it.
I'm not wearing pants.

48
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,905
Come on, that was funny.

49
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,432
Great. Moving on.

50
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:21,574
Where you going? ESPN Classic's
showing the '82 NFC championship.

51
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,747
We could have some nurses over.

52
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:30,431
I called down and requested
a Spanish-speaking nurse.

53
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,874
No English, huh?

54
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,894
I'm a chunky monkey
from funky town.

55
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:44,130
- I'll have trouble translating that.
- Oh, good. It's you.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,670
I admitted this
really neat old lady today.

57
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:51,933
Neat?

58
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:55,146
Dude, the 1930s called
and they want their lingo back.

59
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,564
We had this connection, you know?

60
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:01,341
No, I don't know. Now please,
let me get my sweat on.

61
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:05,053
<i>Surgeons generally don't like</i>
<i>to get too close to patients.</i>

62
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:10,050
<i>Maybe it makes it harder</i>
<i>to cut someone open, or too risky.</i>

63
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,015
I feel like you're missing out.
This Mrs Tanner,

64
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,099
she's got this incredible
energy and warmth.

65
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,385
The League of Women Voters called

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,233
wanting to know
where to send your membership.

67
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,667
You use that
''somebody called'' joke a lot.

68
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:28,531
I can't help it.
I got a hernia patient to take care of.

69
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:31,928
- What's his name?
- His name's Hernia Patient.

70
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,430
But we've gotten close
so I call him Hernia.

71
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:37,688
He must feel so safe
and taken care of.

72
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,424
Shut up.

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,492
I paged Dr Cox and
he should be here any second.

74
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,098
What did she say?

75
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,535
She says it's amazing your fancy
school didn't teach you Spanish,

76
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:57,875
considering
a third of patients speak it.

77
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,488
Like every doctor here speaks Spanish!

78
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,673
What now, Dr Barbie?

79
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:12,048
Mrs Guerrero is a lupus patient
with shortage of breath

80
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,395
so I started her on a heparin drip.

81
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:17,041
- I wanted to run that by you.
- One.

82
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,721
Two.

83
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,222
- Three.
- So, shall I...

84
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,919
It's really important
you let me get to ten.

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,396
- I just thought...
- Listen, cookie.

86
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:30,339
You've been here over a month.
This is Medicine 101.

87
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,898
I don't want everything run by me.

88
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,640
I don't wanna give my two cents
but if you do want my opinion,

89
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:40,846
rest assured it will always be
that you're an incredible pain

90
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,693
and every time
I see your Kewpie-Doll face

91
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,362
it just makes me want
to pick you up and shake you

92
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,760
until all the hours
of my life that you've wasted

93
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,178
fall out.

94
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,999
- Now laugh.
- What?

95
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,510
Laugh so that she doesn't
think I'm yelling at you.

96
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,678
How fun was that?

97
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,593
Just initial.

98
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:13,348
Dr Kelso. I wonder if you could
give me your opinion on a patient?

99
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:17,750
She's a 74-year-old renal failure,
Mrs Tanner.

100
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,003
Of course.
One of our frequent flyers.

101
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,498
- She's a neat lady.
- That's what I said.

102
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,562
Nobody likes a brown nose, son.
Let me see that chart.

103
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,270
Why?

104
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,906
- You put her on diuretics?
- Yeah, I ordered them.

105
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:50,992
These labs don't look good.
It's time she got started on dialysis.

106
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,520
You know what you should
do first, kiddo?

107
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,789
- What's that?
- Find her.

108
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,650
Freedom!

109
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,450
''Went to the park.'' She...

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,776
She went to the park.

111
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,583
It's the Catch.
I say ''Catch,'' no response.

112
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:29,222
How can no one know what the Catch is?

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,010
Niners-Cowboys.
Joe Montana to Dwight Clark,

114
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,644
deep in the end zone,
zero time left.

115
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,317
Don't insult me.

116
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,899
It's the fourth quarter.
Got a minute?

117
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:46,907
- Sure.
- Cool.

118
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,172
- David, right? I'm Turk.
- What's up?

119
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,955
- Want some IV?
- No, I'm good.

120
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,109
- Mrs Tanner.
- Here's the party.

121
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,077
I don't know about others,

122
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,711
but under my care, you stay in
hospital until I say it's OK to leave.

123
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,989
We saved you a plate.

124
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,279
I don't care about food right now.

125
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,209
<i>Are those smores?</i>

126
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:16,892
It's Samantha's fifth birthday.
You're not gonna make me miss this?

127
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,365
Couldn't you have got her a big cake?

128
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,858
I'm gonna order an ABG
just to be safe.

129
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:28,127
- Don't you think?
- That's probably a good idea.

130
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,228
Teach me to tell her she's doing fine.

131
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,011
Say...

132
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,301
Mrs Guerrero?

133
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,108
It worked!

134
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,505
Listen, the important thing to remember
is this won't hurt as much as you think.

135
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,305
I'm ready.

136
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:16,743
You know what, Mrs Tanner...

137
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,818
Just until Samantha
blows out her candles.

138
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,824
What are you gonna wish for?

139
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,579
- A bike?
- Nope.

140
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,092
- A doll house?
- Nope.

141
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,471
How about the ability
to make quick decisions?

142
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,693
- Nope.
- How about this?

143
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,795
- A pony?
- No!

144
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:41,510
Enough. I don't think
you realise how serious this is.

145
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:44,317
We need
to be worried about your mother.

146
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,581
Your grandmother, your...

147
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,238
I'm sorry, we haven't met.
I'm Dr Dorian.

148
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:53,026
- You're very cute.
- Thank you. Come on, let's go.

149
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,980
- Candles are still lit.
- OK.

150
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,940
Here we go. Blow!

151
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:03,328
I increased the heparin
to 1,500 units per hour.

152
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,120
Does that sound like enough?

153
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,191
Should be.

154
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:10,164
Speaking of heparin,
have you slept with Turk yet?

155
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,599
- What?!
- I'm sorry.

156
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,779
Too personal.

157
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,458
I like to wait.
I like a guy to want it so bad

158
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,059
he thinks he isn't gonna get it ever.

159
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,770
When he's lost the will to live,
I jump him.

160
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,323
- So how long does that take?
- A month, maybe two.

161
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:29,828
What about you?

162
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,532
I like to use sex as an ice-breaker.

163
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,840
And how's that working out for you?

164
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:39,455
I guess I don't have what you
would call high self-esteem.

165
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,734
- Let me know when you find the hernia.
- You got it.

166
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,024
- We're so lost.
- We are not lost.

167
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:49,711
- Go left here.
- It's right.

168
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,175
You passed his Cooper's ligament.

169
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:55,088
- Stop and ask for directions.
- You wanna drive?

170
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,486
Cos I will pull over
and let you drive this thing.

171
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,588
Wait a second.
Go back to where you just were.

172
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:09,394
What is that?

173
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:15,719
Her O-sat's in the 80s.
And take a look at her heart rate.

174
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,790
Shoot!

175
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:24,250
That's basically it. Your kidneys aren't
responding to medication any more.

176
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:27,321
We're gonna
have to start you on dialysis.

177
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,168
I'm not a big fan of dialysis.

178
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:32,560
We don't really have a choice.

179
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:35,382
Actually, I do have a choice.

180
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,855
<i>Certain things you never expect</i>
<i>people to say.</i>

181
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,118
I think I'm ready to die.

182
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,811
I've got a ton of bricks for Dr Dorian.

183
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,726
Can I get that pen back?

184
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:22,171
You're gonna have to
shut your mouth at some point.

185
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:26,490
Sweetie, I'm 74 years old.
I'm ready to go.

186
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,952
With dialysis you could
live another 80 or 90 years.

187
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,166
You're being a little irrational.

188
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:34,812
- No, I'm not.
- Everybody dies some time.

189
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,571
No, they don't.

190
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:41,433
Sir, we're really lucky we found
the lymphoma when we did.

191
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,607
Of course. I'll wait till you
get here before I tell David.

192
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:47,415
See you soon.

193
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:51,527
I hope you're not using that phone
to make a personal call.

194
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,410
No, that was David Morrison's father.
He's a patient of mine. A good kid.

195
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:59,819
He sounds terrific. You two
are becoming best pals, huh?

196
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:03,428
What we should do is the three
of us play a game of stick ball.

197
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:07,785
All we need is a stick, a ball
and a pocket full of dreams.

198
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:11,083
Or we could take turns
bowling your patient

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,291
down the hallways of my hospital.

200
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,663
- I can explain.
- Spare me.

201
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:20,362
Spare you. That's good, sir,
cos of the bowling thing.

202
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:23,236
- You're not making a joke.
- Not at the moment.

203
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,951
He's a good kid and he needed a friend.

204
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:31,381
Your patients don't need friends,
they need a doctor.

205
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:35,131
Her BP's dropping. Maybe
it's time to push thrombolytics.

206
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:38,596
- What would you do?
- That's way out of my league.

207
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:42,706
She seems to be decompensating
but thrombolytics scare me.

208
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,186
A lot of times the patient bleeds out.

209
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,964
She needs to know what's going on.

210
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,654
I'll be right back.

211
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:59,507
- She doesn't want dialysis?
- But what does that mean?

212
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:02,882
If she declines dialysis,
there is no ethical dilemma.

213
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,820
But what about our duty
to do everything...

214
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:09,252
''What about our duty...?''

215
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,555
Look, this has nothing
to do with the patient.

216
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:15,736
This is all about you.
You are afraid of death.

217
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:18,508
And you can't be. You're in medicine.

218
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,010
You gotta accept that everything
we do here, everything,

219
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:23,964
is a stall.

220
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:28,115
We're just trying to keep
the game going, that's it.

221
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:31,687
But, ultimately,
it always ends up the same way.

222
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:38,050
- I win.
- Where? I don't see.

223
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:39,980
Here, diagonally.

224
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,289
Pretty sneaky, Death.

225
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,370
Hope I helped.

226
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:52,481
Dr Kelso came down on you, huh?

227
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,890
Yeah, but he's got a point.
This is a hospital.

228
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,752
It's not a playground.

229
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:03,386
Well, if it isn't the medulla oblongata.
That's about 50 points there.

230
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:07,291
I won. I'll just take
your fruit cup and be on my way.

231
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,691
I talked to my dad today.

232
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,435
- He's coming out.
- Cool.

233
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:14,260
And that nurse came by
to shave me again.

234
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:17,058
- I didn't tell her to do that.
- You didn't?

235
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,409
No. I think she's got a crush on you.

236
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:26,500
- Come on, dude, what's going on?
- OK, here's the deal.

237
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:39,212
<i>She's telling her family.</i>

238
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:43,445
<i>There's nothing that could</i>
<i>make me go in there right now.</i>

239
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:07,560
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- It didn't come up.

240
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,448
Look, they don't need that burden.

241
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:13,365
And they'd give me reasons
to change my mind.

242
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,875
Speaking of which,
I took the liberty of jotting down

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,262
a few things I think everybody should do
at least once in their life.

244
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:26,002
OK, number one: eat a sausage
and pepper hoagie from Enrico's.

245
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,242
I've done that.

246
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,644
Number two: go to Asia.

247
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,893
I'll take that as a yes.

248
00:16:38,048 --> 00:16:41,199
And I'll also check off
''learn a foreign language''.

249
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,326
What happened to
''I'll be right back''?

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,115
I can't believe I started to
think I'd been wrong about you.

251
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:59,714
That woman needs her doctor to tell her
something, anything, and you run away?

252
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,057
Are you even gonna look at me?

253
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,514
I've been deciding what drink to get.

254
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,376
Trying to choose between cherry soda
and ginger ale, and you know what?

255
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,302
It's a toss-up.
Either way I get a cold drink.

256
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:16,492
It would be impossible for me to
kill someone with this decision but...

257
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:19,028
I still can't make it.

258
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,289
I think I'm in trouble here.

259
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:24,781
Look...

260
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:29,433
These kinds of decisions
aren't easy for anyone.

261
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,993
If it's any consolation,
one of the reasons I never liked you

262
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:37,221
is you're already better than most
of the doctors that come here.

263
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,600
I kinda liked being the only smart,
strong chick in the joint.

264
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,456
You sort of just complimented me.

265
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,612
A little bit.

266
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,976
OK, I'm gonna have a ginger ale.

267
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:51,641
Good start.

268
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:57,199
That clot isn't going anywhere on its
own, so let's push the thrombolytics.

269
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,417
OK.

270
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,579
Here we go.

271
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,059
Go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

272
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:08,370
- Done.
- Go to the top of the Meiffel Tower.

273
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:12,029
- Now you're making stuff up.
- No, I'm not. It's right here.

274
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,541
Listen, Dr Dorian,

275
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:17,678
there is not one thing I regret
as I lay here right now.

276
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,534
I'm ready. I really am.

277
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,913
- You have had an amazing life.
- Good. Now we agree.

278
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:27,953
Aren't there other patients
you need to be seeing?

279
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,388
Me? No, I've been off for two hours.

280
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:34,616
So with your precious free time,
you've been talking to an old lady.

281
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,671
What about your list?
How many have you done?

282
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:41,994
For that matter, how many times have you
sat on the grass and done nothing?

283
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,293
You need to start
taking some time for yourself.

284
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,864
Promise me you'll do that.

285
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,009
- I will.
- Good.

286
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,377
Now, get outta here. Go on.

287
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,912
I just wanna check out
a few things before I get going.

288
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,004
Are you OK?

289
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,870
- I'm scared.
- Come here.

290
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,064
Come here.

291
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:23,058
You're OK.
You'll be just fine.

292
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,374
Not to worry.

293
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,990
I wanted you to know
she went very peacefully.

294
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,772
I know you did everything
you could for my son.

295
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:33,901
I can't tell you how glad I am
he had a friend here with him.

296
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:42,020
Don't second-guess yourself.
You made the right call.

297
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,242
You did.

298
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,909
I know.

299
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,037
Your mother's kidney...

300
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:52,288
<i>They say one out of every three patients</i>
<i>admitted will die here.</i>

301
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,989
<i>But some days,</i>
<i>the odds are worse than that.</i>

302
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,259
I'm really sorry.

303
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:01,709
<i>And on days like that,</i>
<i>the best you can hope for</i>

304
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,895
<i>is that you took</i>
<i>something from it.</i>

305
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:09,703
Hey, I'm Turk.

306
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:10,930
<i>Anything.</i>

307
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,949
BP's 120 over 80.
Let's keep it that way.

308
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,148
<i>Anything at all.</i>

309
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,042
<i>Even if it's just taking</i>
<i>the time to lie on the grass</i>

310
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,717
<i>and think about all the things</i>
<i>you still have left to do.</i>
