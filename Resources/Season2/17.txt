1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,831
<i>You've been avoiding Dr Cox</i>

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,388
<i>since Jordan told you</i>
<i>her baby was actually his.</i>

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,472
<i>This chance meeting is a sign.</i>
<i>Time to let go of the secret.</i>

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,790
<i>You just need to find a smooth way in.</i>

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,996
Hey, Dr Cox. Taking a whizz?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,311
We've been over this before, Newbie.
Eyes front, no talking.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,755
<i>OK, fine, I'll just read the wall.</i>

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,149
"JD has a tiny pickle."

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,312
Kudos for honesty there, Newbie,
but again no talking.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,356
Dr Cox, I have to tell you something.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,829
Aw, Perry, you pee standing up at work?

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,072
That is so cute. Would you come on?
We're on a tight schedule.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,709
You know, with all the baby weight
you haven't lost yet,

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,270
I went ahead and assumed
you'd be used to tight things by now.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,831
Aw, that's lovely. Well, hello, sailor.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,759
Ahoy.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,833
My goodness, Newbie, are you
so uncomfortable with Jordan here

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,957
that you've in fact,
stopped peeing mid-stream?

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,871
I may have.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,389
Yes!

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,675
I wonder why Dr Cox
and Jordan got divorced.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,832
They act like they hate each other,
but that's just for show.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,239
Yeah, whatever.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,436
Are you going to stretch
before you play?

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,956
<i>Turk likes to blow off steam</i>
<i>by playing basketball before surgery.</i>

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,555
<i>I always get my ass kicked</i>
<i>but not today.</i>

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,872
And that's game.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,711
How the hell did we lose?
We have Chet.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,519
- Sorry, man.
- Chet, you suck.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,435
You know what?
Some stereotypes are true, Turk, OK.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,229
And just maybe, black people
are a little better at basketball.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,151
What do you say?

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,434
- Maybe a little.
- Y'all got hockey.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,477
Why do you think they got divorced?

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,711
No idea. I can't believe
you had to pee in front of Jordan.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,836
I could not do that. Paul's my boyfriend

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,990
and I make him turn the TV way up
when I go.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,959
Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment
an hour before or after I do twosies.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,429
You're a doctor.
Stop calling it twosies.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,512
Oh, with patients I say dookie.
Oh, dookie.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,115
Well, Maggie, I can only assume
you are wiling away the morning

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,432
cat-chatting with your favourite gal pal
because you've finished pre-rounding.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,078
- Haven't started yet.
- What?

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,196
- Gotcha. Finished.
- That's a good one.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,919
- Quite the prankster.
- I could tell some stories.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,197
If there's a God, you never will.
This is Mrs Grayson's chart.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,716
Her private-practice doctor
just showed up so I am off this one.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,792
Well, is there anything I need
to do for her lung nodule?

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,235
I don't know, what do you say
start her on 20 CCs

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,311
of "it's not my problem anymore?"

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,029
<i>Another pretentious private-practice guy</i>

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,998
<i>who'll order me around while</i>
<i>he counts his money all day.</i>

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,197
- Hey, you must be JD.
- <i>He knows my name.</i>

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,034
I'm Dr Fisher, I go by Pete. Never call
me Petey, we'll be friends for life.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,998
Look at this. Don't believe me?
I already got you a latte.

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,911
- Thanks. A latte.
- That's funny.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,436
- We got a good one, Sally.
- <i>How's that funny? Ah, just go with it.</i>

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,308
I always pull pranks. Before, Dr Cox
was like, "Did you do pre-rounding?"

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,789
Sorry to interrupt.
I do wanna hear that story.

60
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,155
Could you get a pulmonary consult
for Sally?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,673
Yeah...

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,548
You're thinking why didn't you do that,
but would it overstep boundaries?

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,995
What if I was a territorial ass
with a giant ego

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,117
or a territorial ego with a giant ass?
Stop me, Sally!

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,078
You're gonna help me.
Help me get Sally out of bed,

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,754
That way, I can go back
to trying to get her into bed.

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,751
- Stop!
- You stop, fo<i>xy</i> lady.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,718
You're doing great.
From now on, follow your instincts.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,268
And you, don't flirt so much.

70
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,792
Wanna make him jealous?

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,995
No.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,230
Thanks a latte. Thanks a lot.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,117
Thanks a latte. I got it!

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,116
<i>At a hospital, there's always</i>
<i>one sure way to deal with boredom.</i>

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,317
You guys wanna go laugh
at the narcoleptic guy?

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,029
<i>It's insensitive, but let's face it,</i>
<i>narcolepsy is a funny condition.</i>

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,953
<i>And it can be triggered</i>
<i>by a number of things.</i>

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,359
<i>Like stress.</i>

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,830
<i>Or anger from, say,</i>
<i>three double bogies in a row.</i>

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,589
- <i>Or, in Mr Hilliard's case...</i>
- Sexual arousal?

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,470
I'm going in.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,632
Is falling asleep after sex
considered narcolepsy,

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,393
cos if it is, Mr Roberts has got it.

84
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,917
First she'll stick her chest out
and then she'll toss her hair.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,353
That's se<i>xy</i>.

86
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,750
- Pen drop.
- Oops.

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,873
That did it.

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,718
Hell, yeah.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,110
I have a boyfriend. Work is going well.

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,555
I feel cute
for the first time in my life.

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,676
My self-esteem cannot be touched.

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,035
It's been so weird since I got engaged.

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,078
You're right, I'll never get married.
Message received.

94
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,594
- This is about me.
- Really? Oh, OK.

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,796
I don't feel attractive at all lately,

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,950
like I've lost my spark or something.

97
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,759
Remember what Kelso said
about your hair yesterday?

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,478
It makes you look frumpy.

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,553
- I thought he said clumpy.
- How is that better?

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,790
You don't know.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,433
- Morning, boys.
- Sir, this is where we play.

102
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,308
Funny, I thought
this was where we worked.

103
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,392
Dr Kelso, I have a low anterior
resection this afternoon

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,438
and I'd really like to exercise
in order to be at my best.

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,988
Well, I'd really like grandkids someday,

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,039
but the last five Christmases, my son
has brought his roommate Brad home,

107
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,429
so you tell me whether life is fair.

108
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,596
You did your residency here, too?

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,150
Are you kidding me? We lived, we loved,
we sang, for crying out loud.

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,630
Laverne, remember that time
you and I got a little crazy, right?

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,871
Went down to the waterfall,
stripped off our scrubs, dove in.

112
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,235
- Remember?
- You hitting the crack pipe?

113
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,118
That's the kinda magic
I'm talking about, buddy.

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,668
- Hey, ladies.
- You must know each other.

115
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,955
- Dr Cox.
- Petey.

116
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,636
<i>Sometimes in an awkward situation,</i>
<i>it's best to go to your happy place.</i>

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,233
It's not uncommon.

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,074
A lot of people keep plants
in their apartment. Right, JD?

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,515
Jay, you're so crazy.

120
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,350
We have a little history, yeah.

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,599
What's up his pooper?

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,116
He's mad cos I went into private
practice and he's in this hellhole.

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,838
That guy was my mentor, man.

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,309
I lived and breathed
for that guy's approval.

125
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,515
That's lame.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,670
Once you learn his tricks, it's easier.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,193
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,998
No, I'm serious. Tell me about it.

129
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,316
Well, you know
when he gets on his rants,

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,154
he gets all hyped up, his veins stick
out of his neck and he starts yelling?

131
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,277
When he's done, look at him,
stare him in the eye and say,

132
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,237
"I'm sorry, what were you saying?"

133
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,470
I don't know why, but it works.
Trust me.

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,199
How do you get him
to stop calling you girls' names?

135
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,748
- Girls' names?
- Oh, never mind.

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,913
Dookies.

137
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,277
- I've got to get this thing fixed.
- Allow me.

138
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,679
May I?

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,909
Ah, yep.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,070
See what you got here is a Medicom XJ.

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,118
It has a hip guard. I'm guessing
it's always coming loose.

142
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,398
- It is always coming loose.
- Been there, seen it, fixed it.

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,199
- Give that a try, missy.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,909
For what? For doing my job? This kinda
thing gets me up in the morning.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,991
That and the smell of urinal cakes.

146
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,430
- I'll see you around. Have a good one.
- Back at you.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,276
- What are you smiling about?
- I just made a new friend.

148
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,309
This is so unfair. Everyone has a way
of taking the edge off.

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,870
You and I, we've got basketball,
Nurse Roberts has got her stories.

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,076
Some guy named DRK
loves Ms Pac-Man,

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,276
cos he's got the high score
of 41 million.

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,998
DRK?

153
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,869
Dr Kelso.

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,517
Ms Pac-Man, I would sex that bow
right off your head.

155
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,398
Eat those dots,
you naughty, naughty girl.

156
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,433
- Hey, Dr Cox.
- Hey, buddy.

157
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,158
I was just thinking about you.

158
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,233
How it might be nice to have somebody
around here who could help me out.

159
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,515
Somebody I could call,
gosh, my resident,

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,875
and we'd do stuff together,
medical stuff.

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,554
It would just be peaches.
But then it occurred to me

162
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,713
a guy who looked a hell of lot
like you used to be that guy.

163
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,916
Monica, just because
you have a new buddy

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,833
doesn't mean you can suddenly
drop your regular duties

165
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,229
and I know
I just said "drop your duties."

166
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,356
And so help me God,
if you even smile

167
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,874
I will crush you
into two little Newbie cubes

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,748
and hang you from my rearview mirror.
What you gotta say for yourself?

169
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,353
<i>Just do it.</i>

170
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,749
I'm sorry, did you say something?

171
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,995
Welcome to today's lecture: the
Biomechanical Reaction Of Dr Perry Cox

172
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,752
When He's Not Being Listened To.

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,558
Stage one: The Jaw Clench.

174
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,432
Quickly followed by stage two:
Syllable Elongation.

175
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,718
Newbie, I re-hee-hee-ly
don't have time to repeat myself.

176
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,349
Finally, stage three, Cox begrudgingly
offers a little respect,

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,273
then distances himself
by overusing the word "there."

178
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,397
But I gotta give it to you there
for yanking my chain there.

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,799
There.

180
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,156
The young soldier is offered a prize
for his courage.

181
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,831
Get ready.

182
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,356
I'll tell you what there, Newbie.

183
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,079
If you wanna
stick around and help me out

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,833
with Mrs Riley's
pericardiocentisis after work,

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,433
that'd be great.

186
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,353
<i>I knew this was his way</i>
<i>of reaching out, but still...</i>

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,954
- I have plans tonight.
- What plans?

188
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,600
<i>Think of something believable.</i>
<i>Grandma died.</i>

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,636
<i>No, if she does die, you'll feel awful</i>

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,518
<i>and she's no spring chicken.</i>
<i>I should call her.</i>

191
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,388
<i>But when we talk, I have nothing to say.</i>
<i>How about asking me how I am for once?</i>

192
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,076
- Newbie.
- My grandma died.

193
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,272
Hello, Mr Hilliard.

194
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,759
Hey.

195
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,071
I just wanna make sure
you're comfortable.

196
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,391
- Who are you?
- They call me Carla.

197
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,311
OK, Carla it is.

198
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,836
Mr Hilliard?
Do I have something on my...

199
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,634
...lips?

200
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,870
Nope. Totally clean.

201
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,517
<i>I felt guilty about blowing off Dr Cox</i>
<i>to grab a beer with Pete.</i>

202
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,195
<i>Of course, that was before</i>
<i>we got Nancy as our waitress.</i>

203
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,113
The kid's a doctor, for crying out loud,
he saves lives.

204
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,273
That's worthy of your respect, or at
least one drunken weekend in Vegas.

205
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,318
- Three-day weekend.
- Three-day weekend. Columbus Day.

206
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,834
That's coming up, right? Come on.

207
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,354
<i>Everyone deals with problems</i>
<i>in their own way.</i>

208
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,517
<i>Some lash out at others.</i>

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,278
<i>Some just end up lashing out</i>
<i>at themselves.</i>

210
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,068
<i>And some people just try to hide.</i>

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,276
Nancy. Nancy.

212
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,039
<i>Unfortunately, that never works.</i>

213
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,836
Hey, Dr Cox. Look, I'm so sorry
I lied to you last night.

214
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,797
I should've told you I was with Pete.

215
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,838
Did we just slip
into some alternate dimension

216
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,718
where I give a flying duckie
about what you say and do?

217
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,394
I know he's in private practice
and everything,

218
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,277
but Pete's a really cool guy.

219
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
He is a bad guy.
And Newbie, if you're smart,

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,638
you will stay away from him.

221
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,551
Oh, my God.

222
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,110
You're actually jealous that
I'm hanging out with another doctor.

223
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,270
- No, I'm not.
- Laverne?

224
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,271
- Jealous.
- Ta-da!

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,875
Marsha, if I were you,
I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.

226
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,758
Don't worry about it, champ.
It's all right to need me.

227
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,072
Touchdown.

228
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,231
- Hi, Happy.
- I'm hideous.

229
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,311
I can't even get Todd
to make a sex joke.

230
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,038
Watch this.

231
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,714
Todd, I'm out of extra-long
tongue depressors.

232
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,792
- Do you have one for me?
- Sorry, Carla, I'm all out.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,598
How did he not say,
"In my pants?"

234
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,399
What is so different
about me since I got engaged?

235
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,075
Wait. I found one. It's not made
of wood, but give me a minute.

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,114
Have you checked
Mr Oberman for hypertension?

237
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,760
Because I've got hypertension
right here.

238
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,239
No way...

239
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,353
Boobies.

240
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,839
Charts.

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,273
- I know it was you.
- You mean this right here?

242
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,193
- This is mine from home.
- 40 million, son.

243
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,875
Do you know how many patients
I had to ignore to get that high score?

244
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,190
- People died.
- Well, what about me, sir?

245
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,191
I need to play basketball.

246
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,034
Since you lost that stupid game,
aren't you more stressed than usual?

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,639
Open! Open! Open!

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,992
- Maybe a little.
- So what do we do now?

249
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,719
Now, this is how you relieve stress.

250
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,592
Dammit to hell.

251
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,758
The janitor's a nice person?

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,319
He is such a sweetie.

253
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,837
I'll ask him an innocuous question,

254
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,276
and his answer will be filled with hate.
Filled with it.

255
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,271
- How's it going?
- Very well, sir.

256
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,316
Thank you for asking.
How are you?

257
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,312
- Do you not see the hate?
- What is wrong with you?

258
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,592
- That was a good one.
- I think so.

259
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,669
All right. Go.

260
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,716
Hold it. No.

261
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,392
He's doing it.

262
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,279
What's the deal, Alpha Dog?
Gonna cut me some slack?

263
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,874
Petey! Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey! Petey!

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,396
OK, good answer.
I understand you're seeing Jordan again.

265
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,835
I just wanted to say,
seriously, good for you.

266
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,275
Know what would be
seriously good for you?

267
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,716
- More bran in my diet?
- Never mention Jordan again.

268
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,552
Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN?

269
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,473
My grandma bought me a stock.
I wanna see how it's doing.

270
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,028
Look at Rockefeller.
Pass me the remote, buddy?

271
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,032
<i>Cool, these guys are finally</i>
<i>starting to get along.</i>

272
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,031
- <i>Or not.</i>
- No big deal.

273
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,918
I'll do one of
these to change the channel.

274
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,076
We can just leave it on this station.

275
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,594
Mr Hilliard, I like my body.

276
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,272
- OK.
- I didn't always.

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,032
When I was ten years old,

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,554
my swim coach told me
my butt stuck out too much.

279
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,474
Now I like it when my boyfriend
looks at my wagon and goes, bam!

280
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,437
You know? I'm OK with my curves.

281
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,274
Women inject God-knows-what
into their face to have lips like mine.

282
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,998
Mr Hilliard!

283
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,559
I can hop out of the shower

284
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,359
and look at my body for ten seconds
without losing it.

285
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,830
That's more than most women.
But when I can't make you fall asleep,

286
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,630
it's like hearing my swim coach's voice
again. And my body doesn't deserve that.

287
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,676
- What can I do?
- Fall asleep.

288
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,591
- I'm not attracted to you.
- Why?

289
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,638
- You remind me of my sister.
- But I'm not your sister.

290
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,110
That's what I'm talking about.

291
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,669
- Had to be done.
- OK, terrific.

292
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,149
Grown-ups tackle each other
all the time.

293
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,196
I can't change what already happened.

294
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,431
But believe me, I never meant
to come between you and anyone.

295
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,273
<i>Watching Dr Cox and Pete</i>
<i>fight over me was...</i>

296
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,715
<i>Oh, hell, I'll say it. It was awesome.</i>

297
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,678
You went and took something
that did not belong to you.

298
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,876
<i>A little possessive, but I'm flattered.</i>

299
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,632
Worse than that,

300
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,792
you did it knowing full well
exactly how I felt about her.

301
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,190
<i>He just wouldn't be Dr Cox</i>
<i>if he didn't refer to me as a her.</i>

302
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,352
Hey, for what it's worth,
I didn't make the first move.

303
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,510
That's a lie. You bought me a latte.

304
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,637
Hey, guys.

305
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,836
We were having problems.

306
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,753
Problems that you knew about
because I confided in you.

307
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,879
What did you do with the information?
You used it to get Jordan into bed.

308
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,713
- Didn't you?
- Perry, come on.

309
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,874
Go.

310
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,752
<i>And finally the reason Dr Cox</i>
<i>and his wife got divorced</i>

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,671
<i>became abundantly clear.</i>

312
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,515
Yes.

313
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,795
Get in there.

314
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,599
- Say it.
- I'm your bitch.

315
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,832
Don't be too hard on yourself. You've
only been playing this for 56 years.

316
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,912
Dr Kelso, is this young man
a guest of yours?

317
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,637
Dave,
I've never seen him before in my life.

318
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,358
Really?

319
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,512
Dave. Hey, man, you don't got...

320
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,956
Yeah, I do.
Don't you run from me.

321
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,679
Kelso!

322
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,435
Hey, hey, Jack Daniels, what's crackin'?

323
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,988
My cousin's volleyball team
has a game tonight.

324
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,674
Tall girls, tiny shorts. You in?

325
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,069
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- I get it.

326
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,720
Still in Perririno's corner.
That's OK, buddy.

327
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,836
Look, just a word to the wise,
all right?

328
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,195
Just be careful
who you hitch your wagon to.

329
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,759
I mean that.

330
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,070
Yikes. I gotta go. OK?

331
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,798
Hi. Can I buy you a house?

332
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,235
<i>I guess sometimes</i>
<i>it comes down to loyalty.</i>

333
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,833
Hey, Dr Cox.

334
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,115
Still no talking in the bathroom,
Newbie.

335
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,113
- Know what's weird?
- That you're allowed to talk?

336
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,636
I never blamed Jordan. I was chief
resident, I was here all the time,

337
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,393
and I always made damn sure
she knew she came second.

338
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,518
But God Almighty,
I'm trying harder this time.

339
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,636
I just hope I'm doing the right thing.

340
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,156
<i>Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it</i>
<i>a secret? Tell him it's his baby.</i>

341
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,629
<i>Scream it from the mountains.</i>
Dr Cox!

342
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,632
- Oh, there you are.
- Hey, babe.

343
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,517
Hi, handsome. How are you?

344
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,557
Oh, hello, DJ.

345
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
- Hey, Jordan. How you doing?
- Oh.

346
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,477
<i>Around here, you have to grab hold</i>
<i>of the littlest victories.</i>

347
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,919
<i>Whether it's victories</i>
<i>over your insecurities.</i>

348
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,352
Dr Kelso...?

349
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,950
<i>Or security's victory over you.</i>

350
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,599
Kelso!

351
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,275
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>you've got to choose your battles.</i>

352
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,477
I want you to tell her the truth.
Tell her that you're a surly,

353
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,835
devious, horrible excuse
for a human being.

354
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,838
Who's that?

355
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,032
- It's my son.
- Oh, my God, JD.

356
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,076
I'm sorry, I didn't even see him there.

357
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,310
No, no, no. I'm glad he heard it.

358
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,188
I think it's important he sees
how the world treats people like us.

359
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,952
I'm so sorry.

360
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,070
Who the hell are you?

361
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,390
Go on. Beat it.

362
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,994
Scram!

363
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,836
All right, stick around.

364
