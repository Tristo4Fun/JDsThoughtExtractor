1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,392
<i>Even close friends</i>
<i>disagree about decisions.</i>

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,233
- This one?
- You want a clear shower curtain?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,959
Just nude up
in the living room and spray me down.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,238
If you're self-conscious I can doodle in
chest hairs where you'd stand.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,118
I have a chest hair. I named him Clancy.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,794
- <i>And then it happened.</i>
- Can I help you, sir?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,598
- Can't believe she called me sir.
- She called me mister.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,275
- Maybe it's because you're bald.
- I'm not bald. I shave my head.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,828
- Well, then let it grow back.
- Careful, honey.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,393
We're practically kids.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,596
What you doing
for Halloween tomorrow?

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,319
We used to dress up as pigs
and hit every bar in town.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,870
You have not lived until
you've seen a drunken pig do the robot.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,192
Not what you used to do,
what you're doing this Halloween.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,759
- We got plans.
- Big plans.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
- Watch TV and sleep.
- Yeah, pretty much.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,594
- I may take a bath first.
- Bubbles?

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Give me some.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,355
<i>It was sad cos I was starting to</i>
<i>think I'd never feel like a kid again.</i>

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,471
Hey, little brother!
It's the headlocking Dan.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,120
- What are you doing here?
- It's funny, Vivian.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,714
I was about to ask you
the same question,

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,236
seeing as I paged you four minutes
and 38 seconds ago.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,754
My big brother Dan.
He showed up unexpected.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,992
- Four minutes and 44 seconds.
- Easy there, Chief.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,550
Have one of those nurses pour you
a big glass of calm-down juice.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,632
It's so interesting,
I found I couldn't sleep last night,

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,589
so to pass the time, I made a list of
things that annoy me more than you.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,753
I came up with people
who call Wednesdays "hump day,"

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,070
and, of course,
all Sandra Bullock movies.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,958
Now I'm thrilled to announce,
your brother tops...

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,272
Chief, does this speech have an
intermission? I got to take a whizz.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,390
Actually, I'm not so keen on nicknames
from guys that barely know me.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,995
Actually, why don't you tell me
what you are keen on?

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,799
- Oh, Dan, no.
- Where's the crapper?

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,119
What brings you to town?

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,033
Some guy hired me to fly here,
drive his Mercedes back.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,076
It's an easy way
to pick up extra cash.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,516
- Plus you get to hang out with Bambi.
- <i>Maybe he'll let that go.</i>

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,874
Bambi?

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,793
- It's a term only Carla uses.
- I respect that, Bambi.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,317
Smart. You do not want to get on his
bad side and suffer the wrath of Bambi.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,879
Why are you here?

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,192
Room 310's tests came back negative. I
thought you'd want to give him the news.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,872
- Let me do it.
- What?

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,190
- I can be a doctor.
- I can't let you tell him.

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,271
I won't call you Bambi anymore.

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,631
It was touch and go.
You're a fighter. You pulled through.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,996
We'll get you out of here today.
Keep an eye on those rickles.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,117
- Rickles is my last name.
- You bet it is. Do you have kids?

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,918
- Two.
- That's what I'm saying.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,878
Watch the little Rickles.
Children are our future.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,518
Doctor, we need you.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,357
Bambi, I'm busy. It's hard to find a
good male nurse these days. Am I right?

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,351
Dan wasn't just the captain of every
team. He was the mayor of high school.

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,795
The jocks dug him,
the burn-outs dug him,

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,235
- the nerds worshipped him.
- What about you?

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,151
- He mentioned nerds.
- Why hurt me?

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,117
I thought I'd be cool
in high school,

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,749
then my dad made me play the tuba
and I developed massive forearms.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,992
Half-way through the prom, my gloves
exploded like I was the Incredible Hulk.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,709
It's se<i>xy</i> to dance with a woman
who can lift her partner over her head.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,509
<i>It's nice when your friends and family</i>
<i>click. It makes you feel like...</i>

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,194
<i>Wait a second, is she still laughing?</i>

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,592
Stop your laughing.
It makes you look like a whore!

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,871
Joking.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,520
I appreciate everything
you did for my husband.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,239
The funeral's tomorrow.
I'd love if you attended.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,233
Unfortunately, I'm in surgery all day.
But, I'm sorry for your loss.

70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,588
Dodging the funeral? Nice.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,795
Excuse me?

72
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,190
Just a veteran move from
the baby-faced sophomore.

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,955
The whole "I'm sorry for your loss"
thing was a little Hallmarky,

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,510
but darn it all if you're not showing
just a ton of promise.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,750
If I could be there, I'd be there.

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,517
Wait a second. You treated him, right?
So you should want to go too. Right?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,272
Gandhi, for your information,

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,955
I attended that vegetable's funeral
every time I set foot in his room

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,031
over the last six weeks.

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,680
Thank God the family
moved him to surgery

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,629
where you guys were good enough to help
him kick that nasty o<i>xy</i>gen habit he had.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,438
That's great. Make jokes.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,876
I wish I could be an insensitive,
cynical robodoc like you,

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,599
but unfortunately,
I don't hate the world enough.

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,671
You know what I'm saying, Chief?

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,753
Would people please
stop calling me Chief?

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,512
Hey, numbnuts.

88
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,915
Dan, remember when we were kids
and every Halloween you used to try

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,752
and scare the crap out of me?

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,233
I remember that.

91
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,472
So while I'm here
we should play some frisbee golf,

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,156
maybe give Dad a call, and make sure
I sleep with that Elliot chick.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,674
That's a little weird for me cos...

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,957
I don't know if you know this...
but, we used to be intimate.

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,634
Intimate? What did you do? Bathe her?

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,518
Yeah, once,
but she was wearing a swimsuit.

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,036
I'll back off. It's gonna be tough.
She sounds kind of wild.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,313
Can't teach it.

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,953
You got an opposable thumb.
You can use it. God, I hate Halloween.

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,237
Somebody needs to adjust their attitude
if they want candy.

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,949
You mean the popcorn balls
and the deformed lollipops?

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,270
Honestly, where do you get
this crap?

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,310
I made it. If you want name-brand candy,
my fist is packed with peanuts.

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,992
Of course it is.

105
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,275
Did Raggedy Ann scare you?

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,828
What are you, a rat?

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,593
- Don't listen to him.
- I never do.

108
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,877
Dr Cox, your intern asked for
a surgical consult on Mr Carney.

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,190
- Yeah.
- I suggest you do a fem-pop bypass.

110
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,077
Mr Carney's a frail old man

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,038
who'd probably snap in half
from a light sponge bath.

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,430
If we do surgery,
we could improve his quality of life.

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,478
The guy's 1,000. Is he gonna take
a steamer over to Europe

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,348
open a café and finally meet that
900-year-old girl of his dreams?

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,998
I've made my recommendation.

116
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,799
You stood up for what you
believe in. I respect that.

117
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,950
- 20 bucks says you kill him.
- You're on.

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,473
You got it, baby.

119
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,154
I need some sugar over here.

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,877
Can anyone tell me

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,953
the dermatologic condition
associated with Rhinophyma? Dr Murphy?

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,759
Could it be psoriasis?

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,833
And yet further proof
that the clown costume is redundant.

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,510
If any of you other would-be revellers
get the urge to dress up

125
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,398
on this, the mother of all non-holidays,

126
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,314
please consider me the razor blade
in your caramel apple.

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,550
We're professionals, damn it!

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,917
You know, it's nothing personal, son,

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,230
you just make me sick.

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,953
He called me son!

131
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,393
Score.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,875
You going to lunch with your brother?

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,669
Yeah, I would've invited you,
but I made the reservation for two.

134
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,752
- So change it.
- I'm not gonna mess with that hostess.

135
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,354
- She uses sharp tones.
- Yeah, right.

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,991
Three seconds to give me the real reason
I can't come, or I'm coming.

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,595
Three, two, one.

138
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,115
Because I need special time
with my brother.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,872
- Trick.
- Excuse me?

140
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,839
I figure you got to be wondering
am I gonna get a trick

141
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,911
or am I gonna get a treat?

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,515
- You'll be getting a trick.
- Whatever.

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,751
It'll be fast
and you won't even know it's me.

144
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,311
- You just told me it was gonna be you.
- You'll still have your doubts.

145
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,710
The best part is
you're gonna be nervous all day about it

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,110
cos it could happen at any time.

147
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,151
Like now!

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,073
That wasn't it. Fun, though.

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,957
False alarm, boys.

150
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,432
All right. Here we go, Mr Carney.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,916
Dr Wen, I want you to stay focused.
I want Dr Wen to be Dr Zen, man.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,834
Christopher, after 15 years
and over 10,000 surgeries,

153
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,558
I can do without the pep talk.

154
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,915
Message received, sir.

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,474
I believe in you.

156
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,949
<i>Big deal, we're having lunch together.</i>
<i>It doesn't have to be awkward.</i>

157
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,031
- What's my bro like in the sack?
- What?

158
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,678
You do not have to answer that.

159
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,878
If he tries hard, but there's room for
improvement, sip your drink.

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,875
- What? I was thirsty.
- Ask me if she could be better.

161
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,392
What? Thirsty.

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,596
I wasn't thirsty.

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,071
Stable condition.

164
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,913
What time is it? Time to dance.

165
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,119
- Pay the man.
- There you go.

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,316
Hello, Mr Jackson.

167
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,109
I want to introduce you
to the Washington brothers.

168
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,875
Y'all get nice and cosy up in my wallet.

169
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,599
Before you get too high
on your horse, Tonto,

170
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,274
I feel it's my duty to remind you
of something.

171
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,515
See, you just made a $20 bet on whether
a fellow human being would live or die.

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,432
Now tell me, just exactly how does
that make you feel, Mr Sensitive?

173
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,353
Pretty good? All the best.

174
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,113
Why'd you drive someone else's car
across country?

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,316
It's a great way to make 300 bucks.

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,595
What do you do that
you can take time off?

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,353
- I tend bar.
- But not just any bar. It's "the" bar.

178
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,238
When the college kids come home,
it's where they go.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,357
- I go there when I'm home.
- So you live in your home town?

180
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,671
I take care of my mom's place
so she let's me stay with her.

181
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,318
Dan, you don't stay with her.

182
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,837
Come on, he's not like Greg Brady
in the attic with beads for a door.

183
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,831
He totally has his own space.

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,196
More like Kirk Cameron
in the last season of <i>Growing Pains</i>

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,670
when he lived above the garage
with Boner. Anyone? No.

186
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,796
Am I the only one? Boner?

187
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,713
<i>That's when I realised that</i>
<i>even though I was jealous,</i>

188
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,758
<i>that's not why I was trying to keep</i>
<i>Elliot and Dan apart.</i>

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,909
Dan's doing great.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,958
<i>The real reason was</i>
<i>that I was ashamed of my brother.</i>

191
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,951
<i>And I think he knew it too.</i>

192
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,554
You two should probably
get back to work.

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,517
These heated seats are amazing.
They make my butt tingle.

194
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,353
Every time you say that,
an angel gets their wings.

195
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,319
It's a sweet ride, but as JD has made
clear, I could never afford this car.

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,709
Would you please just let it go?

197
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,031
- So I'll see you.
- Not if I see you first.

198
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,918
<i>I knew my brother would</i>
<i>handle this like he always did</i>

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,798
<i>when there was an</i>
<i>emotional conflict between us.</i>

200
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,394
- Can you work the windows from there?
- No. Why?

201
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,717
Oh, God...

202
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,870
Please tell me
that that was the horn.

203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,475
- There's your heated seat, my friend.
- God, it's everywhere.

204
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,157
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting on you?

205
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,470
Next time, if you're not here
in 30 minutes,

206
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,074
I expect a free dead body
or some garlic knots.

207
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,549
Dr Kelso,
that's extremely insensitive.

208
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,838
I don't think so.
Miss Parker, you care to weigh in?

209
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,593
Nope, she's fine with it.
She knows a thing or two.

210
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,036
Except, of course,
that a yellow light means to slow down.

211
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,873
You're not understanding
what I'm trying to say.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,595
- Kitty, this sucks.
- How can I make it better?

213
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,799
- Thank you so much for coming.
- We've been looking forward to this.

214
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,990
You know, ever since he... he died.

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,312
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

216
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,517
You and your brother.
The tension was palpable.

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,195
I wanted to say something. I was
this close to getting back in the car.

218
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,431
That wouldn't have been wise.
No, thank you, we're fine.

219
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,116
Damn you, you dirty ape!

220
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,955
Babe, you have got to try one of these.
They are to die for.

221
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,838
I'm sorry for your loss.
Go ahead. Try one.

222
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,637
Mother, this is Dr Turk,
the surgeon that worked so hard.

223
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,429
Oh, please,
it's the least I could do for...

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,988
You see,
he doesn't even remember his name.

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,392
No, no, no I remember his name.
His name was...

226
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,159
His name was... was...

227
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,077
You know, we used to call him
Old Chicken Neck.

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,118
This is the problem with doctors today.
They don't care.

229
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,192
No, it's just that recently
I've had a lot of patients.

230
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,840
So it... I've gotten...
I've been really busy.

231
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,959
Not too busy to come here in the middle
of the day and stuff your face for free.

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,076
- Damn you, woman.
- Ladies, please.

233
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,675
This is a good, caring doctor.
He did everything he could for Bob.

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,273
Right.

235
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,708
This is Bob. That's Bob?

236
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,597
Like for apples, you know, bob.

237
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,876
I get it. Let's see how tough
you are without your costume on.

238
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,669
Go ahead and knock the folders
out of my hand now.

239
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,038
- What costume?
- You weren't wearing a gorilla suit?

240
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,749
Is someone running around
in a gorilla suit? What's he look like?

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,195
- A gorilla.
- No, it's not me.

242
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,556
- Why knock the folders from my hand?
- Because you asked me to.

243
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,870
Here you go.

244
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,714
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- That comes free with the folder knock.

245
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,397
- How are you doing?
- Good, sir.

246
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,436
I don't have time to stand and flirt.

247
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,672
There have been rumblings that you let
your brother play doctor the other day.

248
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,034
Dr Kelso, I...

249
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,874
If I had one shred of evidence
that incident actually took place,

250
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,748
you'd be working with my nephew Francis
so fast it'd make your head spin.

251
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,434
- Sir, I don't follow.
- He cleans pools.

252
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,873
I forgot you didn't know.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,032
I trust we will not be seeing
your brother in the hospital.

254
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,073
Not inside, no.

255
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,151
My God, I'm totally going to hell.

256
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,028
Turk, wait, people get thrown out
of funerals every day.

257
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,073
Why are you laughing?

258
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,516
Off the top of my head,
I'd say it's because he's suffering.

259
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,275
Of course, I love the poetry of
someone putting himself on a pedestal

260
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,035
then getting knocked back down
into this puddle of self-hatred

261
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,157
- with the rest of us.
- Did you do this to him?

262
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,598
I don't know. Does anybody ever
really do anything to anybody else?

263
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,911
You're gonna tell me why
you did this and it better be good.

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,549
How does "for poops and giggles"
grab you?

265
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,871
Isn't there something you want to talk
about? Like cars or sports or boobs.

266
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,110
Boobs. Remember Fred Keifer's mom?

267
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,476
She wore a tank top
to Fred's 13th birthday party.

268
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,791
She taught us how to bob for apples
and three guys passed out.

269
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,236
Great story. Now how about something
with more substance?

270
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,517
- Remember the cans on Pat Clark's mom?
- Those were awesome.

271
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,113
Forget it.

272
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,079
Elliot, come on.
What does she expect us to talk about?

273
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,789
Maybe that you're embarrassed by me
you make excuses to your friends

274
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,711
about how I live my life.

275
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,399
Oh, yeah.

276
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,998
We're working hard on a cure.

277
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,913
- Let's go. Field trip.
- I got things to do.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,233
Off to another funeral? Come with me
and if you're late for the graveyard,

279
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,790
I'll scour the obituaries with you
this weekend and we can go nuts.

280
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,677
- Carla put you up to this?
- My idea.

281
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,311
I want to be close with you. I just
can't figure out how. Turn around.

282
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,311
Turn around.

283
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,317
You see Dr Wen in there?

284
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,030
He's explaining that something
went wrong and the patient died.

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,240
He's gonna tell them what happened,
say sorry, then he's going back to work.

286
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,632
You think anybody else in that room
is going back to work today?

287
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,759
That is why we distance ourselves.
That's why we make jokes.

288
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,992
We don't do it because it's fun.
We do it so we can get by.

289
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,516
And sometimes because it's fun.

290
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,040
But mostly it's the getting by thing.

291
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,711
And by the way...

292
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,478
Bob.

293
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,710
Who doesn't get that?

294
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,558
We're proud you became a doctor, but
just because I haven't achieved as much

295
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,713
- doesn't mean I don't like what I do.
- Nothing wrong with being a bartender.

296
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,633
- I like living with Mom.
- She makes great eggs.

297
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,794
All in all, I'm pretty damn happy.
I'm happy, you know.

298
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,351
<i>And now for the apology.</i>

299
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,877
That's a load of crap.
Look, I know you, OK?

300
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,758
The reason you wanted
to pretend you're a doctor

301
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,753
is cos you hate working in that bar
and you wanted to feel like somebody.

302
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,799
You're not driving that car
across the country for the $300.

303
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,917
You're doing it cos you like how
you feel when you drive it.

304
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,798
The funny thing is
you could be that guy.

305
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,714
But you're afraid that if you have to
try at something, you might fail,

306
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,156
and that's not
a chance you're willing to take.

307
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,308
What can I say?
It's been a real pleasure seeing you.

308
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,870
<i>Right then, I knew I'd never see</i>
<i>my brother the same way again.</i>

309
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,190
<i>You can never let go</i>
<i>of the kid inside of you.</i>

310
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,953
That girl in the wolf outfit
is checking you out.

311
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,952
I'd let her blow my house down.
You know what I'm saying?

312
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,675
<i>You see, it's the kid inside of us</i>
<i>that keeps us from going crazy.</i>

313
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
