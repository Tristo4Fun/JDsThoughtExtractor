1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,794
<i>Maybe it's because</i>
<i>spring is around the corner,</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,474
<i>but lately it feels</i>
<i>like romance is in the air.</i>

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,755
- How's that?
- You close your eyes too early.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,035
And you always go in right.
Try going left.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,429
- The girls'll dig that.
- OK. Fo'shizzle.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,353
What's up, girl?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,908
Nothing that dog did in life
could deserve that.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,755
What you talking about? My man's single,
he's running drills to keep sharp.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,752
It would be great if you never
mention this to anyone, ever.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,994
Are you crazy? You know she'll say
something. We're talking about Carla.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,878
- So now I'm a gossip?
- Yeah, you gossip all the time.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,076
- Since when?
- Since ever. To everybody.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,278
<i>It's weird, ever since they got engaged,</i>
<i>Turk and Carla have argued constantly.</i>

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,189
You want some kibble?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,034
<i>I guess I always hoped that the longer</i>
<i>you're a couple, the easier it got.</i>

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,948
No noise.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,634
And the whole world gets it.
You love your body.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,314
Put your damn shirt on,
no one's making a calendar.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,109
And be a sweetie and get me a juice,
will you? Thanks so much.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,078
As much as it may seem
like it to me personally,

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,995
I feel desperately compelled to remind
you that we are, in fact, not in prison.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,150
And I am just so not your bitch.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,708
Watch your language
in front of the baby.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,916
You're gonna have
to trust me on this one.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,197
Seeing as you're his mother,
he's gonna hear that word early,

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,195
and he's gonna hear it often.
Like... non-stop.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,955
<i>Maybe it's easier to be a new couple,</i>
<i>because you can't see what's ahead.</i>

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,794
Tonight, I am going to make
all of your fantasies come true.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,509
You know, I would be happy
just to have sex above the covers once.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,071
Yeah. Never gonna happen.
Now, follow my voice to the bedroom.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,116
Over here.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,952
You're in trouble tonight.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,639
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,156
Don't take the blindfold off!
I'll get a towel to stop the bleeding.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,630
<i>The safest thing for a couple</i>
<i>is to find a routine and stick with it.</i>

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,879
Ted, have you noticed how happy
all the minions are lately?

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,112
- I wish I was dead.
- Yep. People love working here.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,838
Good morning, sweetheart.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,830
<i>It all makes me glad I'm on my own.</i>

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,353
<i>I don't think I'd have it...</i>

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,873
Hello, ladies.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,077
Just window shopping,
or would you like to try something on?

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,390
Aren't you the guy
that makes out with dogs?

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,038
Carla. A quick word.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,197
Is anybody else a doctor?

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,717
I need you to extubate
the young fellow in 304

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,236
and start an insulin drip on Mrs Adler
for the third time this month.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,279
God bless diabetics
who continue to drink. Oh, and Lassie.

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,399
In response to the bestiality
rumours circulating about you,

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,359
I've decided to forgo calling you
by the usual girl's name

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,752
and instead I'm gonna refer to you
by whatever famous dog I can think of.

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,990
I've gone with Lassie because,
of course,

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,834
that satisfies the criteria
of being a girl and a dog's name,

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,434
thus helping you
ease into the transition.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,556
I was just running kissing drills.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh. That's completely normal, then.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,430
Don't bring that filth over here.

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,273
Dude. TCW's back.

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,397
<i>TCWis a horrible story.</i>

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,109
<i>She was married for three weeks before</i>
<i>her husband got in a car accident</i>

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,077
<i>and became a total vegetable.</i>

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,789
<i>He's been on life support for two years.</i>
<i>Since he was transferred to us,</i>

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,111
<i>she's visited every Wednesday.</i>
<i>Very, very sad.</i>

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,792
<i>Oh, and she's a babe. We call her</i>
<i>Tasty Coma Wife. Or TCWfor short.</i>

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,552
- How's he doing?
- You know. He's the same.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,758
How are you doing?

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,593
I was calculating how much time
I need to spend here

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,069
so I don't feel guilty all week.

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,709
Now I need to double it,
because I can't believe I said that.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,598
I think you're allowed to do
what you want, Mrs Moyer.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,558
- Please, call me Jamie.
- Jamie? OK.

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,471
You have something on your cheek.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,075
What? Workin' in a hospital,
it's always something.

74
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,116
- Yeah, I got it.
- Did you get it?

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,111
No, not yet.

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,916
- How we doin' today?
- Excellent, sir.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,150
- No one going to hell in here.
- Super.

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,350
You've always known
about my sleep toots.

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,556
You used to imitate the sound, remember?

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,949
I make Mr Roberts
wear special air-tight boxer shorts.

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,836
I wrote the guest list for this
conversation, and you're not on it, OK?

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,717
So just... As for you,

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,076
could you go one day without
making a big deal of everything?

84
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,673
One damn day, woman.

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,469
Carla, would you take this young
man back to his room in Paediatrics?

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,915
Apparently as a form of social protest,

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,959
he chewed on and subsequently
swallowed part of a Rolling Stones CD.

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,395
Tell you what, Ralphie,
they sold out for good

89
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,994
once they started doing
Ford commercials, eh?

90
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,594
- We'll talk later.
- Come on, Ralphie.

91
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,319
- I had that inside of me.
- What, now?

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,470
He's just making stuff up. Come on.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,348
I swallowed that ring.
My dad had to wait for me to go No.2.

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,954
The black doctor gave me ten bucks
to keep quiet.

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,033
Good show today.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,270
Elliot. A blindfold?

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,070
- Way to step it up, Miss Nasty.
- You told him what happened.

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,435
We were bonding.
What are you eating?

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,318
Turkey jerky. Protein, baby. Go for it.

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,913
- No, thanks.
- Don't like it?

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,479
- Never tried it.
- Never?

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,312
Jerky rocks. You'll love it.

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,392
I've put a lot of thought into this
and I'll have to pass.

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,358
So, eight stitches,
and now you don't trust me?

105
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,556
And you wanted above-the-covers sex!

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,352
I feel your pain.

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,476
<i>Luckily, I'm a competent enough doctor,</i>

108
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,870
<i>I'm not gonna let myself get distracted</i>
<i>thinking about Jamie.</i>

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,997
Can you really hear my heart
if it isn't in your ears?

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,038
- Did you go to med school?
- No, I mean...

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,872
No, you didn't. Thank you.

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,678
<i>The problem is that I'm in a rut.</i>

113
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,479
<i>I just need someone to go out</i>
<i>and get a beer with me.</i>

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,198
I can't tonight.

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,955
If I have more than one beer,
I'll most likely kill myself.

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,431
Can't. You seen Turk?

117
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,192
Married.

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,908
- Can't swing it tonight.
- Come on, player, just a few beers.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,197
And if we accidentally run into
some skanky hos, then so be it.

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,793
I'll go.

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,110
I totally need to blow off some steam.

122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,749
Plus, the best way to meet skanky hos
is to already have a girl with you.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,035
- Not that I need any help.
- Pff! Hell, no!

124
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,313
You got something...

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,309
Oh, my God.
I gotta tell you about that day.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,913
I haven't named him yet.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,197
I've been calling him Monkey Face.
They'd tease him at school.

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,191
Seriously, I had this one patient...

129
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,430
He's got a boodgie like a grape
in his nose.

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,671
Would you run back to the hospital
for a suction thingy?

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,479
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
I don't want you to worry

132
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,235
because it simply means I drove
by a prostitute on the way home.

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,151
Make sure it's a girl.

134
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,795
Please don't do this.

135
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,236
- Do what?
- The whole drama-queen thing.

136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,437
The jerky incident is what
is wrong with our relationship.

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,509
Thank you.

138
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,668
Every lunch, someone hits me
with a spit-ball.

139
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,230
<i>I'm still not sure how I feel</i>
<i>about Paul and Elliot.</i>

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,793
Nice day, huh?

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,996
Always got something to say, don't you?

142
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,674
Old Nosy Nelly
always gotta throw his two cents in.

143
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,354
OK, I'm sorry about the nice-day thing.

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,749
How can I make this right?

145
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,876
What's it, biscuit and gravy day?

146
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,236
- Yeah.
- Just give me one of them biscuits.

147
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,239
I thought you were ready.

148
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,030
How does
this whole wing-man thing work?

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,918
Essentially, you have to think
of yourself as chum.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,879
Your job as chum is to lure
attractive women closer to the boat.

151
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,316
<i>Mental note. The Boat could be</i>
<i>a very cool new nickname.</i>

152
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,675
Hey, baby. Would you like some of this?

153
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,671
- Look at that.
- No, no, Jamie.

154
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,512
A little aggressive. Sorry.

155
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,397
- Did you like her?
- No, no.

156
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,789
Her ass was way too perfect.

157
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,239
- Can't believe I'm having fun.
- I'm glad.

158
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,118
So, Tasty Coma Wife, huh?

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,718
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,189
I've heard some idiots call you that.

161
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,077
- I kinda like it.
- I thought it up.

162
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,639
Cheers.

163
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,271
Is this true?

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,556
- Ralphie, I paid you ten dollars.
- This is disgusting.

165
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,790
- Why is it?
- Because it was in my butt.

166
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,678
I'm serious. I want you to shut up.
Shut your mouth now.

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,318
- Would you wear this?
- Baby!

168
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,709
I've had this steam-cleaned three times.

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,189
Not only would I wear it,
I'll put it in my mouth.

170
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,233
What?

171
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,469
It's fun to eat things.

172
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,948
Scooby.

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,679
A married woman whose husband
is still in a coma?

174
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,514
Can't tell you how many happy couples
I know who got started just that way.

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,716
Will you relax? We just got a beer.

176
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,631
What you got there?

177
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,917
One hundred free booger suckers
and you'll say nothing.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,471
Toto, please, oh, please,
keep hanging out with her.

179
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,235
Because I'm gonna enjoy watching
this one bite you right on the ass.

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,629
And I good and guarantee you, she will.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,348
<i>People in relationships</i>
<i>always dole out advice</i>

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,591
<i>even though they're usually</i>
<i>the ones that are messed up.</i>

183
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,113
See you, Elliot.

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,192
<i>Whether they're considering</i>
<i>breaking up over a Slim Jim.</i>

185
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,752
<i>Or having their stomach pumped.</i>

186
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,675
<i>Orjust desperately trying</i>
<i>to get attention.</i>

187
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,198
<i>So I'm not gonna sweat it</i>
<i>just because I made a new friend.</i>

188
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,872
<i>I mean, what's the big deal?</i>

189
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,831
- Hey.
- Hey...

190
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,990
May I come in?

191
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,914
- He likes you.
- He must smell my dead dog.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,675
You haven't asked why I called
your work, pretended to be your sister,

193
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
got your address,
and showed up late at night.

194
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,473
You've got a lot going on right now.
I'm sure you're a little confused.

195
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,755
It's time for me to start my life over.

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,230
I would love to take you out to dinner,
if you'd be interested.

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,753
<i>Holy crap!</i>

198
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,638
Jack wouldn't want my life to be over.
My husband.

199
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,948
- Mr Moyer.
- Call him Jack.

200
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,076
- I'd rather not.
- I know it's weird.

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,072
- But give it some thought, OK?
- Of course.

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,911
- Hey.
- Hey.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,036
- All right, I'll see you.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,075
Dude. Was that...

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,276
Was that Tasty Coma Wife?

206
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,429
Yeah.

207
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,952
<i>You'll figure out what to do.</i>

208
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,996
<i>For God's sakes, you're The Boat.</i>

209
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,116
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Jack.

210
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,270
- What?
- Cold chart.

211
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,192
<i>Good cover.</i>

212
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,919
Five letters. "Showing vulnerability."

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,116
"A blank in one's armour."

214
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,709
- Chink.
- What?

215
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,870
Chink!

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,196
No. No, Franklyn, we were...

217
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,669
We were doing
a crossword puzzle and...

218
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,480
- I always suspected.
- We all did.

219
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,872
Franklyn, no.

220
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,791
Wow. Tough break.

221
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,794
OK, Mrs Brady, we'll break up
your kidney stone with lithotripsy.

222
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,155
We're gonna put you on Percocet
for the pain.

223
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,037
I can't take painkillers.

224
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,917
Justin's still breastfeeding.

225
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,790
You like milk, do you?

226
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,917
Why don't you get on your bike,
go to the store and get some?

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,231
<i>I think at a certain point,</i>
<i>breastfeeding becomes creepy.</i>

228
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,756
- You are such a little cutie.
- Mom, I'm trying to eat here.

229
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,717
- But...
- Mom.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,877
Benji, come.

231
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,308
What is with mothers
doting on their children?

232
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,154
My God. It's like nobody else
exists in the world anymore.

233
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,515
But I tell you,
and you can take it to the bank,

234
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,989
my mother never paid
that much attention to me.

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,799
- It doesn't show.
- Word to the wise there, Astro.

236
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,429
Sarcasm does not sit well with
the Big Dog, so consider this a warning.

237
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,149
The next time I hear you mumble some
little passive-aggressive aside,

238
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,232
I'll look into your heart,
pick out your insecurity,

239
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,278
and shine a spotlight on it
for the remainder of your days.

240
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,157
Now, riddle me this, Fido.

241
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,516
Just exactly why does every Asian person
who's passing us by

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,511
keep giving you the old stink-eye?

243
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,670
Oh, you're imagining things.

244
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,517
Ow.

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,636
It's just been hard for me lately.

246
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,075
I don't really have anyone
special in my life.

247
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,958
I'm pretty much either here
or at home doing nothing.

248
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,634
Yeah, that's rough. I'm in a coma!

249
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,757
I've had an itch on my foot
for the last eight months.

250
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,198
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. It's a new therapy.

251
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,275
You'd trust me on something
important to me?

252
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,429
Course.

253
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,317
See? That's what I'm looking for.

254
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,076
We're talking about dried meat.
Why would you get in the middle?

255
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,912
I don't know what I was thinking.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,958
- Is that a straw?
- No, this is just a pen.

257
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,758
Pink scrubs.

258
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,194
Well, there it is,
all cleaned up for you. Enjoy.

259
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,353
Well, why don't you keep it?
In case you get hungry later.

260
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,715
Oh, you think that's funny,
huh, Ralphie?

261
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,631
Pay me my ten dollars.

262
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,634
Son, a hospital staff
is like a melting pot.

263
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,790
We all need to respect each other.

264
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,193
If you think a specific ethnic group
is loud, lazy or sneaky...

265
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,874
Or incredibly closed-minded
and inappropriate.

266
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,157
Exactly!
Just keep it to yourself, dammit!

267
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,989
What?

268
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,038
Nothing, sir.
I just thought of something funny.

269
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,749
Maybe what you should do
is saddle up your mop and head upstairs.

270
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,719
Someone has vomited in the second,
third and fifth-floor hallways.

271
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,756
What? It's not my fault.

272
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,990
Ralphie. Let's ride.

273
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,951
Good work. Here's your 20 bucks.

274
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,951
You can throw up whenever you want to?

275
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,315
- Hell, yeah.
- We should look into that.

276
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,517
You know, right after you
blow chunks in the elevator.

277
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,036
- Hey, stranger.
- Hot!

278
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,078
<i>It's weird realising you missed someone</i>
<i>you barely know.</i>

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,037
Wait. Make me proud.

280
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,432
Good God.

281
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,997
I decided to take Jamie out on a date.

282
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,640
- Who?
- You know, Tasty Coma Wife?

283
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,073
- No way.
- Nice job, Hooch.

284
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,116
Tell you what.
Give me a little time,

285
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,873
and I'll rig it so that
the husband can come with you.

286
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,997
I'll have him sittin' up
right next to you, no problemo.

287
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,958
- What do you say?
- I'm free and I love Italian.

288
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,157
- You be quiet.
- I can't believe you, Bambi.

289
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,356
- She is so right.
- What are you thinking?

290
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, Rin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin-Tin.

291
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,072
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
And shut up! OK?

292
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,957
Who are you to give me advice?

293
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,079
All you do is just bitch about
your relationships all day long.

294
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,596
You know what? Glare all you want,
Big Dog, cos I'm not afraid of you.

295
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,069
"Jordan's only paying
attention to the baby."

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,435
Must be so hard for Dr Look At Me.
Isn't it?

297
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,397
Look at me!

298
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,153
And you two?
You're arguing since you got engaged?

299
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,879
You're probably the first couple
to do that ever.

300
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,110
It can't be that you're just scared,
is it?

301
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,636
And you. Let's just forget
for one second that, a month ago,

302
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,075
you told me you couldn't be
in a relationship.

303
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,912
Because, for me, it's actually fun

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,037
to watch you sabotage
your relationship from the outside.

305
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,594
The only thing that gives me comfort,
you guys,

306
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,114
is while I'm at home,
staring at the ceiling,

307
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,191
just wishing I had someone to talk to,

308
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,636
is knowing none of you idiots
realise how lucky you are.

309
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,638
Did I miss something good?

310
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,594
- Thank you so much for dinner.
- You're welcome.

311
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,956
But what was the deal
with tipping $20 on a $30 bill?

312
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,794
Ah, nothing. I just love Chinese food.
And the Asian people.

313
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,637
What should we do now?

314
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,597
Kiss me.

315
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,472
I could do that.

316
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,794
Mm. You went left. Very cool.

317
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,632
<i>Thank you, Rowdy.</i>

318
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,156
So, it's cold outside.
You wanna come back to my place?

319
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,990
I think you might be moving
a little fast for yourself.

320
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,595
And there's a part of me
that's very angry I just said that.

321
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,311
I'm so sick of being alone, you know?

322
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,152
Tell you what, look me in the eyes

323
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,915
and tell me that you're ready
to start something right now,

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,672
we won't even need a cab.

325
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,557
I will throw you over my shoulder

326
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,950
and just sprint
the 12 miles to your house.

327
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,478
But...

328
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,471
I'll call you sometime.

329
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,398
I hope you do.

330
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,188
Bye.

331
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,513
<i>I don't think people</i>
