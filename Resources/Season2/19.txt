1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,353
<i>One thing that never changes here</i>
<i>is the stupid idea</i>

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,637
<i>that surgeons are cool</i>
<i>and medical residents are geeks.</i>

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,549
Oh, Rudy.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,552
- Lose the grapefruit goggles.
- It squirts in my eyes.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,030
That's a risk you take
with that particular piece of fruit.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,998
You guys, come on,
what do you say we dial down

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,469
the whole power-nerd thing
a little bit, OK?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,877
Are you starting
your surgical elective tomorrow?

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,839
Is that tomorrow? Whatever.
I don't really give a crap.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,311
Take a picture! Take a picture!
And you better smile this time.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,514
You guys look so cute.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,273
Carla, do you think
you could cut these for me?

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,069
I've been working out so much,
these things are choking off my pythons.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,116
- You know?
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,354
At the end of the week, you gotta return
these bad boys to Janine.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,516
Janine's built like a bear.
She curled me once.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,388
<i>Entering the hospital as a surgeon</i>
<i>has a whole different feel to it.</i>

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,116
Dude.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,159
You OK? You're acting weirder than the
time we saw Pat Benatar at Starbucks.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,390
How amazing was that morning?

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,471
Listen, do me a favour.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,154
Don't try to overdo it
with these guys, all right?

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,958
Just be you. OK? Be yourself.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,395
You know how I do. What's up, fellas?

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,232
I know, I'm usually medical.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,278
I just want you guys to know
I consider you all my peepies.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,597
<i>They know you mean peeps.</i>
<i>Just change the subject.</i>

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,831
- Somebody's been working out.
- What?

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,909
Help me.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,914
- Dr Cox.
- Work. I hate you. You suck.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,752
I've been trying harder lately.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,071
Barbie, talking to the computer,
but nice self-esteem.

33
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,355
Hey, cowboy.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,319
How about you back off the little lady
and we'll all agree you're scary.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,358
Listen there, I know
that your pink scrubs are balled up

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,035
at the base of Barbie's bed three nights
a week, and congrats on that,

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,715
but if you're going to have a showdown
with everyone who hassles her,

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,314
then, gosh,
you two aren't gonna have any time

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,313
for that sweet Aryan sex
that you love so much.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,790
- Hit the bricks, toe-heads.
- Come on, let's go.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,031
Why have we never fixed
or replaced this monstrosity?

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,473
You know the deal.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,994
If it barely works,
it won't get replaced.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,595
I guess that explains why your ass
is still on the payroll, huh?

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,830
Somebody stop me!

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,830
- Morning, sport.
- Morning, captain.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,751
Am I the first they've done this to?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,274
No, man.
They did this to Frank Fracherman.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,033
- Who's Frank Fracherman?
- You're the first one.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,633
- Help me.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,434
All right, don't sweat it, OK?
Stay on your toes.

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,799
Sorry, girls, dropped my computer.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,675
Remember, when surgical residents
sense insecurity, they attack.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,275
- I'll watch out for that.
- Dude, your face, your face.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,796
- Man!
- Yeah, let's lose the tail too.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,832
How'd they get that on there, dawg?

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,957
Buddy, I've got your back.
But lay low for awhile.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,996
- No problem.
- All right, people.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,435
How long till we get this thing started?

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,635
Probably not for a few minutes.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,197
Should I file my Bell Biv DeVoe CD

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,430
under B for Bell Biv
or under D for DeVoe?

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,671
I don't know why you let Dr Cox
push you around like that.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,638
Do you notice that you're
always telling me what to do?

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,756
I mean, in a good way.

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,877
Then how come I'm growing
my bangs out and wearing a thong?

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,871
You look better without the bangs.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,351
And the thong, well, that's not
up to me, that's the law, Missy.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,069
Not now. You know I don't like kissing
while I'm alphabetizing.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,709
Just so you know, I'm not folding
my clothes before we do it tonight.

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,518
Yes, you are.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,591
Hey, Elliot, I just want to tell you

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,399
that the last few weeks
have been really amazing.

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,879
Thanks.

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,151
I love U2.

76
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,037
What did you just say?

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,792
I said, I love U2.

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,556
Dr Kelso, I was able to locate
the discharge form you wanted.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,078
She's a beauty, isn't she, Ted?
My pride and joy.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,549
I just had her varnished,
so don't touch.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,955
Here, hand it over.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,474
- Ted, you're a simpleton.
- That's funny.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,915
Cos I thought
I was rubber and you were glue.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,433
Idiot.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,471
- Principal Bob, you called?
- Can you explain this?

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,676
It appears to be a wiring problem.

87
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,719
Either way, second floor
desperately needs a new computer.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,876
Jackass.

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,430
I was talking about him, you buffoon.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,957
Removing the old heart.

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,749
- All right, JD, get in there.
- <i>Turk's always looking out for me.</i>

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,229
I told you I'd hook you up.

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,429
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,796
<i>Here it's my first day in surgery</i>
<i>and I'm holding a human heart.</i>

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,435
We were done with that one,
right, guys?

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,392
- What you got there?
- Circular saw. Just bought it.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,836
Four horsepower, 3,500 rpms,
titanium finger guard.

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,638
Why would you need a saw?

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,678
- Why would a hen need a banjo?
- Why does a hen need a banjo?

100
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,716
Why buy a saw
if I had no stuff to cut?

101
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,189
- You wouldn't. That'd be crazy.
- Exactly.

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,951
You need some help with that?

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,031
No, thank you, I'm fine.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,792
Dammit.

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,631
No, that'd be crazy.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,552
I was talking about U2 the band.
You know what? It's fine.

107
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,235
He probably thinks I was saying it
the way you would say "I love eggs."

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,709
I'm sure there is not
going to be a problem.

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,637
We have a telegram
from Nurse Paul Flowers.

110
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,999
That name is funny.

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,594
This is my band.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,638
Oh, my God, Ted,
everybody knows. TV themes.

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,838
That's old news, doll face,
we do commercial jingles now.

114
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,589
<i>The best part of waking up</i>
<i>Is Elliot in your cup</i>

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,159
<i>In your cup...</i>

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,832
That's it?

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,508
<i>By Mennen</i>

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,075
<i>It felt weird</i>
<i>not going to my normal table.</i>

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
<i>Especially on</i>
<i>Palm Pilot Synchronization Day.</i>

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
And... now.

121
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,908
<i>But I was in surgery now.</i>

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,275
<i>Still, even though Turk</i>
<i>was trying to help,</i>

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,112
<i>I felt like such an outsider.</i>

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,397
I can't believe my girlfriend's
dragging me to the ballet.

125
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,153
Your girlfriend?
Or your boyfriend?

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,231
What's up?

127
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,551
Turk did ballet.

128
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,279
I just used it to help with my agility
for sports, that's all.

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,998
You know.

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,594
I never wore the clothes
or anything like that.

131
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,398
Actually...

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,153
Dude, close the door, close the door!

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,878
I'll get you.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,599
Who wants some more?
You got... OK. Here's some.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,673
I have no words.

136
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,150
How about handsome? Or glorious?

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,233
And this abomination is the reason
we can't afford a new computer?

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,799
Well, that...

139
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,111
and the medical boondoggle
I have to go to in Cleveland.

140
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,919
And by medical boondoggle,
I mean golf weekend,

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,797
and by Cleveland, I mean Hawaii.

142
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,997
Do you have any idea what people
around here think of you?

143
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,753
I go to bed some nights wondering.

144
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,400
And you know
what happens to me, Perry?

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,031
I fall asleep.
And I mean like a log, brother.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,432
Anyway, I have to go catch my bus
to the airport.

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,432
And by bus, I mean helicopter.

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,479
I'll be right back.
Mr Dunaway somehow managed

149
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,074
to wet both his and Mr Spiller's bed.

150
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,151
You're slouching.

151
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,474
You never explained
that U2 thing, did you?

152
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,313
I've been thinking.
Maybe it's not such a bad thing.

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,834
Things are going well.
Maybe it was fate.

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,708
I could have looked at my Bell Biv DeVoe
CD and said, "I love Bell Biv DeVoe."

155
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,268
Which I do, by the way.
And I'm not ashamed of it.

156
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,992
I think that if you guys
are meant to get to this point,

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,718
it'll happen naturally.

158
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,836
You're right.
"I love U2." Dammit.

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,388
Why do I say every thing
that comes into my head?

160
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,711
I wish you wouldn't stand close to me
after your hummus break.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,234
See? I didn't need to say that.

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,276
I'm gonna tell him.

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,635
- Love you.
- Love you more.

164
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,999
You know what?
Brush your teeth, then judge me.

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,193
<i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>it was nice to feel accepted.</i>

166
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,999
Remind me to burn that CD for you.
All right, player.

167
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,072
Weight room later?
I might be able to get you two tickets.

168
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,469
- To what?
- To the gun show, dawg.

169
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,277
<i>Sometimes you can't help</i>
<i>but get caught up in the moment.</i>

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,517
<i>When that happens, you never know</i>
<i>what you're going to do.</i>

171
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,034
What's that all about?

172
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,157
I'm afraid Dr Kelso has passed away.

173
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,590
<i>Or what you're gonna say to someone.</i>

174
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,716
I can't wait for my parents to meet you.

175
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,313
Me neither.

176
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,069
<i>But if things are going well,</i>
<i>you should just ride the wave.</i>

177
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,993
Hey, T-Dog,
who are we slicing and dicing today?

178
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,516
Well, J-Dog, I don't know
who you're slicing and dicing.

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,592
I assigned you to another surgeon.

180
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,796
<i>What? Why?</i>

181
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,829
<i>You deserve Ted's band today</i>

182
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,072
<i>So get up and get away...</i>

183
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,469
Ted, you guys suck.

184
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,354
<i>So what if Turk switched me</i>
<i>to another surgeon?</i>

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,908
<i>I can't worry about that now.</i>
<i>I'm here to learn.</i>

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,638
Are you even paying attention?

187
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,029
I'm sorry.
Is it time to excise the tumour?

188
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,829
No, it is time to realise
that we're operating on a naked chick.

189
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,797
We will high-five later.

190
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,474
<i>And then I realised</i>
<i>why Turk was so pissed.</i>

191
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,316
<i>He was the geek now.</i>

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,118
You're gonna get
in so much trouble for this.

193
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,633
It's a joke.

194
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,678
No one's going to believe
Kelso actually died.

195
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,718
I don't know
if I should be alone tonight.

196
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,750
He's with Jesus now.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,990
Tough break, big guy.

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,232
Turk, Turk. Wait, wait, wait.

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,471
Look, I can totally get you back in
with all the surgery boys.

200
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,039
Can you? Really? Totally?

201
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,475
I'll just talk to them.
Schmitty, Schultzy,

202
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,472
Trigger, Fig Sack, Small Pete,
Little Pete, Tiny Pete,

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,391
The Jackal, Aardvark and Steve.

204
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,710
Dude, who the hell
are you talking about?

205
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,679
We all went out last night. I made up
some new nicknames for all the fellas.

206
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,671
By the way, you're Slappy Bag.

207
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,637
You've lost it.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,395
- Come on, Slappy Bag.
- Don't call me Slappy Bag.

209
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,111
- I told you you had nothing to saw.
- Really?

210
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,949
Man, give it back.

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,430
All right. Just tell me
why you're hitting yourself.

212
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,192
Why are you doing that?

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,749
Ever feel like
we're thinking the same thing?

214
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,068
No.

215
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,549
Hey, slow down on that Brie.
You know what cheese does to you.

216
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,029
Yet another good tip.

217
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,870
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about us lately.

218
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,633
- Me too.
- God, you drive me crazy.

219
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,199
You drive me crazy.

220
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,350
I just lay awake
at night thinking about

221
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,238
how unbelievably lucky
I am to have you in my life.

222
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,393
Sometimes you're so controlling,
it makes me want to strangle you.

223
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,674
My nose!

224
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,593
Elliot,
are you trying to break up with me?

225
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,469
Sorry, cheese.

226
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,311
Coming through.

227
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,755
Holy cow. You just
clean out a guy's office

228
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,512
the second he goes deady-bye?

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,797
- We can come back later.
- No.

230
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,189
The quicker these memories
are removed,

231
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,635
the sooner all of us
can get on with our lives.

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,757
There's no way this desk
is fitting through that door.

233
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,990
- I got it.
- Who are you?

234
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,753
Just a man with a saw.

235
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,034
Ten. Careful with that.

236
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,476
- I think I can manage.
- That's a great set, Arnold.

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,074
You got string
hanging from your sleeve there.

238
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,355
I'm sorry, that's your arm.

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,908
Sorry I told the surgeons
about your ballet.

240
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,309
I don't give a crap
what these clowns think.

241
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,995
Todd camped out in a wizard outfit
to see the last Harry Potter movie.

242
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,958
You swore you wouldn't tell.
We even high-fived on it.

243
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,871
Todd, we high-five on everything.

244
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,758
That's such a lame excuse.
I'm totally pissed at you.

245
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,478
High five.

246
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,075
You were so desperate for the approval
of all these stupid surgeons

247
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,355
you sold me down the river, huh?

248
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,352
Oh, yeah?
Not all surgeons are stupid. OK?

249
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,716
Fig Sack here went to Dartmouth.

250
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,439
Wait, you're Aardvark.

251
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,511
Schmitty?

252
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,715
Hey, Bobcat. Welcome back.

253
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,633
Look it, this whole thing
was a joke that, admittedly,

254
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,233
got a little out of hand.

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,279
In the meantime, this blank cheque
ought to cover the damage.

256
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,351
A joke?

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,398
Think it's funny they already
gave away my parking spot?

258
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,109
Or that one of the surgeons
paid his dwarf cousin, Lance,

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,193
$200 to show up at rounds
and sing <i>Ding-Dong, Kelso's Dead?</i>

260
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,117
- And there it is.
- There what is?

261
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,478
This whole l-don't-care-what-
people-think-about-me act.

262
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,232
It's pretty convincing.

263
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,834
But methinks there's
a sad little cartoon boy

264
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,797
living inside the hairy beast.

265
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,998
He's sad because, at the end of the day,
he realises the only thing people think

266
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,072
is what an evil son-of-a-bitch
he really is.

267
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,589
See you later, Bobigator.

268
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,793
If this cheque bounces,
I'm coming for you.

269
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,391
How you doing, Ted?

270
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,792
OK, here's what you do.

271
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,519
Say that even though
our relationship is ending,

272
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,318
you don't have any regrets.

273
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,756
My God, are you actually telling me
how to break up with you?

274
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,354
You're right. Go ahead.

275
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,911
If you could just start me off,
that'd be super.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,468
Just tell me
we had a lot of fun together.

277
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,675
We did.

278
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,558
- Mostly you were really happy.
- I was.

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,835
Say that you wished
you were mature enough

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,388
to talk to me
about what was bothering you,

281
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,472
because even though
I can be controlling sometimes,

282
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,836
I really would have worked on it
for someone as special as you.

283
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,589
You know what's funny?
When I said I love you,

284
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,877
it was an accident
and I never really loved you at all.

285
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,951
That is an absolute riot.

286
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,838
No, I just mean that I wonder
how things would've gone

287
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,275
if that had never happened.

288
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,430
Me, too.

289
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,754
Hi, can I buy you a drink?

290
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,637
No, I'm good. Thank you.

291
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,036
You see that, that right there?
That has never happened to me.

292
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,918
A hot girl has never asked
to buy me a drink.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,036
Appletini, please. Easy on the tini.

294
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,430
- No problem, lady.
- Man...

295
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,195
Ever since college you always
make everything seem so easy.

296
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,636
No matter where you are,
you always fit in.

297
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,439
I don't know, I thought
with this surgery elective,

298
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,988
it might be nice not to feel
like a total dork.

299
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,559
JD, Look at me.

300
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,598
- You are a dork.
- Not all the time.

301
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,274
Every second
since the moment I met you.

302
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,233
Hey, I'm JD. I am so stoked
to be your roommate.

303
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,311
Right on.

304
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,312
What are you talking about?
You said hoops were cool.

305
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,039
Hey, baby. Champag-nee?

306
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,509
Med-school chicks love ventriloquists.

307
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,239
He's right, they do.

308
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,471
Tannest intern, baby.
And it comes in a bottle.

309
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,120
Appletini, please. Easy on the tini.

310
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,031
The thing I always liked about you
was that you were yourself,

311
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,236
never cared about
what people thought.

312
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,515
And that's why you hung out with me?

313
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,558
No, you had a car. Still do.

314
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,269
Come on, player,
you know I'm way more stud than dud.

315
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,915
Wow, you can really taste the apples.

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,275
<i>I think everyone would like to believe</i>

317
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,749
<i>it's possible to become</i>
<i>someone different.</i>

318
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,035
<i>To change how people see us.</i>

319
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,112
I told you he'd buckle.
How's that new computer? Good?

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,714
We wouldn't know.
This one's from like, 1970.

321
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,756
What did he do with the new one?

322
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,839
<i>But sometimes change</i>
<i>doesn't last for long.</i>

323
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,959
By golly, you're so pretty,
I may not even use you.

324
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,830
<i>And other times it just makes</i>
<i>you miss what you had.</i>

325
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,670
<i>A little.</i>

326
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,518
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>I'm happy just knowing who I am.</i>

327
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,629
Hey, JD, do you have any nasal spray?

328
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,393
No problem, Dougster.

329
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,515
<i>For I am John Dorian.</i>

330
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,749
<i>King of the Nerds.</i>

331
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,990
Hey, JD, you OK?

332
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,234
I'm fine.
Don't bogart my nasal spray.

333
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
