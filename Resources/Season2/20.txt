1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,957
I can't believe you're bitching.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,032
I asked you to look after him
for an hour three days a week.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,031
Do you know how much
I need a massage?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,477
Are you getting all sore around
that hump where your tail used to be?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,189
When Gustave promises me something
will feel great and last an hour,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,955
he doesn't end up five minutes later,
thinking he made me see God.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,759
So not Gustave. Busy doctor.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,719
<i>I think Dr Cox would be willing</i>
<i>to help if he knew it was his baby.</i>

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,509
What do you say, Stephanie? You step up
to the plate and tell the guy.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,549
I'm only three weeks old and already
I've got more stones than you do.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,474
- One of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
- It's not my place to tell.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,555
Newbie, I know that your ovaries
are absolutely tingling

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,315
at the furry sight of this little
fellow, but you gotta snap out of it.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,072
I gotta get to that funeral.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,596
Raise my rent if you're not
off to see Tasty Coma Wife.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,636
Her husband was in a coma so long,

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,280
she forgot what
an attractive male looked like.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,433
Enter Errol Flynn,
whose conscience will not allow him

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,750
to either swash or buckle her.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,913
Since hubby is now worm food,
I'm guessing all bets are off.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,357
If you have trouble getting the baby
to sleep, just tell him that story.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,113
Well, I'm gonna get going.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,033
<i>No one else will bust my chops</i>
<i>about the funeral.</i>

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,112
<i>Around here, you tend to get</i>
<i>wrapped up in your own world.</i>

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,077
<i>Whether trying to plan your day...</i>

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,958
Should I take a dookie
before or after I lift weights?

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,919
After.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,833
<i>...or trying to live out</i>
<i>your deepest fantasies...</i>

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,916
Damn it, don't you die on me.

30
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,268
Clear.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,477
<i>Maybe you're breaking in</i>
<i>your new Italian shoes...</i>

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,551
Those shoes look a little small.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,279
<i>..or break down the spirit</i>
<i>of your whipping boy.</i>

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,828
What do you know
about appearances, Ted?

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,798
- Have you looked in the mirror?
- Not lately.

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,670
But when I do,
it's reflection perfection.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,911
<i>One way or another,</i>
<i>everyone makes it all about themselves.</i>

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,797
I gotta fix my own copy machine.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,599
Maintenance man
says he has more important things.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,035
Isn't he fixing the heat
in Paediatrics?

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,917
Whatever.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,198
<i>No matter what Dr Cox thinks, I wasn't</i>
<i>going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.</i>

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,796
<i>I was going to pay my respects.</i>

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,671
JD, I'm so happy you came.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,513
You look fantastic.
And, you know, I don't mean,

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,831
"Hey, dude, check out
that hot biddy at the bar" fantastic.

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,990
"I'm sorry for your loss" fantastic.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,436
- Do you wanna grab a drink?
- Let's get the hell outta here.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,511
I was actually talking about him.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,795
Oh, yeah, I know. So was I.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,632
No, order. He's bussing those.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,231
Somebody's a smoker.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,476
Look at my baby sleep.

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,949
Isn't he an angel?

55
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,669
I wonder what's going on
in that shiny head of his.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,396
This will only hurt a little.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,871
OK.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,798
Thanks again for coming.

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,189
<i>Just get out</i>
<i>without doing any more damage.</i>

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,349
I had a blast.

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,793
<i>Nice job.</i>

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,236
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you.

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,149
I'm sorry, everyone.
I dropped something on my toe.

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,315
You know. Carry on.

65
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,116
<i>She's probably feeling awful</i>
<i>so say something reassuring.</i>

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,431
- You're going to hell.
- JD, we've been over this.

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,433
I loved my husband,
but he's been dead to me for two years.

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,718
I can't tell you how happy I am
to finally have some closure

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,314
and my first orgasm in like, forever.

70
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,913
You know, Jamie,

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,275
there are a lot of ways to grieve.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,679
Last time I checked,

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,955
wheelbarrow style wasn't one of them.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,792
I am OK, JD.

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,156
- I'm seeing things clearly.
- You're confused.

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,719
- I'm happy.
- You're sad.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,438
- I'm at peace.
- You're at war.

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,717
I think it's really cute
that you're worried about me.

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,751
But when am I gonna see you again?

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,350
I will see you at home
in about an hour.

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,238
Remember, keep him warm,
support his head,

82
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,074
check his diaper every 15 minutes,
no bouncing around, no loud noise,

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,071
no TV, no poking the soft spot,

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,479
and, Perry,

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
you're the only one
I have to say this to.

86
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,395
Do not yell at, demean, insult,

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,074
criticise, humiliate, or mock the baby.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,799
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,316
- Have you named this thing yet?
- I'm naming him after my father.

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,753
- Tax Evader?
- Quinn.

91
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,115
How about a heterosexual name,
like Jack?

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,510
You're right, Percival.
Quinn is a foofy name.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,592
Skip Jack altogether
and go with whatever you think.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,511
Whatever makes you comfortable.

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,591
Jack, Jack, Jack...

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,792
Nothing, huh?

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,033
My God, this is so boring.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,234
- Turk.
- Yeah?

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,993
Between my list of family and friends
and yours,

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,550
we have 400 people coming to this
wedding. How can we cut this down?

101
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,870
Whose list did I end up on,
yours or Turk's?

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,353
- Mine.
- Let me see.

103
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,398
- Nope. Gotta go.
- What's her problem?

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,950
I'm wondering if
my prescription deodorant isn't working.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,110
Not for the odour, for the wetness. See?

106
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,599
Don't touch me.

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,592
I must stop touching my pits
and rubbing them on people.

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,908
Yes.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,630
Still, it's not that.
I sort of had a sex dream about you.

110
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,631
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,076
- Was I the girl?
- Yeah, you were the girl.

112
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,470
Can you just do me a favour?
Don't tell Carla about this.

113
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,835
She'll just get all jealous
and disgusted.

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,832
But we haven't done anything
for her to be disgusted by.

115
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,990
Oh, yeah, we did.

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,032
<i>I'm gonna try not to call Jamie. I know</i>
<i>she shouldn't be in a relationship yet.</i>

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,156
<i>Still there were a lot of questions.</i>

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,153
<i>Was she going to be OK?</i>
<i>Did I leave my underwear at the funeral?</i>

119
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,470
<i>And how did I end up</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere</i>

120
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,950
<i>without realising I've never</i>
<i>had to pee this badly in my life?</i>

121
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,032
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,155
You saw the janitor's window crank,

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,152
and think you may have seen
a little melanoma on there?

124
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,994
Then it's your obligation as a doctor,
and your privilege as a woman,

125
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,514
to go back and ask him
if you can't see it again.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,310
I'd love to help, but I'm baby-sitting
the only other being on God's earth

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,076
who's needier than you. Now, in the
meantime, I need you to tell Mr Mueller

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,357
that his liver has lesions on it
and it doesn't look good.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,832
<i>Unfortunately, Mr Mueller</i>
<i>doesn't speak a word of English.</i>

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,717
Hi, Mr Mueller.

131
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,508
<i>Danke.</i>

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,955
- What's he danke-ing you for?
- I don't know.

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,635
This is so frustrating. I wish
there was some way we could connect.

134
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,954
Nah, that'd never work.

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,870
There's my boys.

136
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,632
Has it been an hour already?

137
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,030
I know. Sometimes I get lost
just looking at his face.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,556
I can't do this tomorrow.

139
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,949
Kelso's got me doing
a cardiology lecture.

140
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,917
Don't worry about it.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,436
It's just tough to miss
precious moments like this.

142
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,234
- Hey, baby.
- So how's it work?

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,515
You get to fantasise about vanilla wafer

144
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,273
and I get whatever "Hey, baby"
you throw my way?

145
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,999
Forget it.

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,470
- What the hell, Elliot?
- It slipped out. I'm sorry.

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,916
- Sorry's not good enough.
- You're right.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,914
Harder, dammit. I've been bad.

149
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,232
Dr Turk.

150
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,515
- Do you have a question?
- No, sir.

151
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,955
The Todd will close.

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,396
I'm freaking out. I can't stop
having sex dreams about Elliot.

153
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,633
All done. Continue.

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,076
Every time I close my eyes,
she's doing something kinky.

155
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,594
Very, very kinky.

156
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,669
<i>This is perfect. In here</i>
<i>I can accidentally see his wiener</i>

157
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,796
<i>and then give him medical advice.</i>

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,950
<i>Just be subtle.</i>

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,672
Can I take your order?

160
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,673
- How come you're not unzipped?
- Cos I'm not peeing.

161
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,716
This is where I come for my breaks.

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,473
If I stand out there,
everyone tells me to do stuff.

163
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,312
Look...

164
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,834
...Janitor,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,514
I saw your penis
and I noticed a possible melanoma

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,158
you should have checked out.

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,198
- When did you see my penis?
- When you were showering.

168
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,430
- Where were you?
- Outside in the bushes.

169
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,838
It was just a coincidence.

170
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,718
If you'd looked outside
you'd have seen my penis.

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,789
What? Why?

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,235
Because I had it out
while I looked at yours.

173
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,231
<i>OK, regroup.</i>

174
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,076
You must be Dr Dorian.
I am Rolf's brother, Hermann.

175
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,038
Hermann the German.
You must get that all the time.

176
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,712
No, first time.

177
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,468
Let's hope it catches on.

178
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,950
Well, I could really
use your help translating.

179
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,439
Oh, sure.

180
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,318
I got the results back from your biopsy.

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,313
The lesions in your liver are consistent
with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

182
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,239
- What is the prognosis?
- It's not good.

183
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,517
<i>The key to any good relationship</i>
<i>is communication.</i>

184
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,874
Hi, baby.

185
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,918
<i>If you're not open with someone</i>
<i>it'll catch up with you.</i>

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
Weird. I could swear
that while I was in surgery,

187
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,395
I heard you describe se<i>xy</i> dreams
about someone named Elliot.

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,352
- Come on, get him.
- Up.

189
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,670
<i>If you're not honest,</i>
<i>you'll get busted.</i>

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,638
So, to summarise, if this basketball

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,678
was a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction,

192
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,548
glyco-protein 2B-3A inhibitors
would be initiated early on.

193
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,712
- You buying this?
- No. Can I see that?

194
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,319
<i>But what do I know?</i>
<i>Two days ago, I had funeral sex.</i>

195
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,073
I met your patient, Mr Mueller.
We had a nice chat.

196
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,436
- You speak German?
- I can do a sweet little milkmaid.

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,792
I can do an evil old <i>hausfrau.</i>

198
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,199
German's such a beautiful language.

199
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,430
I think Mr Mueller's so amazing.

200
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,193
Yesterday I pretty much told him
he was gonna die.

201
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,078
And his brother turned to him
and he said...

202
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,318
- Mr Mueller just accepted it.
- Why wouldn't he?

203
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,835
...means, you're gonna be fine.

204
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,833
Germans.

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,669
Tell me he said, "My brother told me
the truth, I'm dealing with it."

206
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,672
He said, "When I get home,
I'm eating a chocolate cake."

207
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,558
Why did you lie
to your brother about his condition?

208
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,039
You talk too fast.

209
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,151
He didn't want to upset his brother.

210
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,754
Lying isn't gonna make his brother
any better.

211
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,513
We got Mr Mueller's ultrasound back.

212
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,512
His biliary obstruction's relieved,
he's taking PO.

213
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,874
That's good, yes?

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,878
I need you to crunch the numbers
on next year's budget.

215
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,520
That's a job
for the accounting department.

216
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,033
I'm an attorney.

217
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,716
Speaking of crunching, I'm jonesing
for some Double Stuff Oreos all day.

218
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,631
See if you can't hook me up.

219
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,793
Now Mr Mueller is doing so much better,
I'm not sure if telling him the truth

220
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,598
is even the best thing for him.

221
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,910
What you're saying is
you have a problem

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,675
that is totally your problem,
but you'd like to make it my problem?

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,638
But, here's the problem, Newbie,
it's not my problem.

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,280
So let's stop talking
about the janitor's junk?

225
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,558
I'd like to hear nussing about ze German
and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife,

226
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,358
even though she's on your mind.

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,431
- No, she's not.
- Yes, I am.

228
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,474
Since we are sharing,
I have to go and face Jordan

229
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,109
and tell her I didn't ditch
her hatchling on account of being lazy.

230
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,034
Whenever I'm alone with that child,
you know what I feel?

231
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,236
Nothing.

232
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,393
What do you say, you wanna trade
your big problems for mine?

233
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,438
- No, thanks.
- It was worth a try.

234
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,950
What was that about?

235
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,712
You're right, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,396
I've been working really hard
on not being such a busybody.

237
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,391
So tell me, was she a good kisser?

238
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,993
Excuse me.

239
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,314
If you're having dreams
about another woman,

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,278
maybe you're not ready for marriage.

241
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,351
- Baby.
- Just take it.

242
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,273
Are you crazy? Baby, it was only
a sex dream. Everybody has them.

243
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,477
- Right, Ted?
- No, not me.

244
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,109
I just have the one dream
over and over.

245
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,832
I hold his head under the water
till the last bubble goes bloop.

246
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,149
Ted.

247
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,312
What's the ETA
on those Double Stuffs?

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,718
Bloop.

249
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,154
OK, I still wanna refer you
to a dermatologist,

250
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,708
but it looks benign to me.

251
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,268
Benign, benign-and-a-half.

252
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,669
<i>Then he said something</i>
<i>I didn't expect.</i>

253
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,797
- I don't like you.
- <i>Not that. I expected that.</i>

254
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,115
I know this was uncomfortable
and I appreciate your concern.

255
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,476
I'm a doctor. I had to tell you
what was going on.

256
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,551
Don't touch me with those hands.

257
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,268
- This is awkward.
- Elliot.

258
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,157
Could you be quiet, please?

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,151
OK, but you could just fall asleep

260
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,277
then I might just creep into your head
and rock your world.

261
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,430
Elliot, you don't get it, do you?

262
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,830
Since I met Carla,
I haven't dreamt about another woman.

263
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,230
Turk, you're engaged.
I mean, it's a huge commitment.

264
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,713
It's totally natural to feel trapped, or
uncertain, maybe even a little scared.

265
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,789
Really?

266
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,118
Sorry.

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,072
- Baby?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,628
Have you dreamt of anyone
since we got engaged?

269
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,190
No, baby, but I understand.

270
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,999
Come here. Let me give you
something to dream about.

271
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,954
See if you can find my tattoo.

272
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,912
- Hey, Jordan.
- You know, it's funny.

273
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,675
I can't even be pissed
and want you to die screaming in agony

274
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,230
as horses pull you apart
when I'm looking at this beautiful face.

275
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,870
Jordan, I gotta tell you something.

276
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,748
You know, I love my dad,
but he just doesn't look like a Quinn.

277
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,752
Maybe cos he's not drunk
and yelling at your mother.

278
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,037
What are you? A Kevin? A Billy?

279
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,474
Jack?

280
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,397
All right. Jack it is.

281
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,233
What the hell.
All right. You take him.

282
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,029
- What did you wanna tell me?
- Nothing.

283
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,356
He wants to know
why his brother lied.

284
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,908
I guess he was trying to protect you.

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,993
Or he thought he was protecting you,
but he was really protecting himself.

286
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,674
I forget what protect is.
You used it five times.

287
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,511
Just like my brother.

288
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,155
Always thinks he knows
what's best for me.

289
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,554
<i>It's funny how one person</i>
<i>leads you to another.</i>

290
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,632
<i>I knew Mr Mueller's brother</i>
<i>shouldn't try to protect him</i>

291
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,792
<i>and yet I was doing</i>
<i>the same thing to someone else.</i>

292
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,235
- Excuse me. Jamie.
- JD?

293
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,915
A patient was mad at his brother
for presuming to know what was best,

294
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,399
and that got me thinking.

295
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,358
I was freaking out that we hooked up
at the funeral.

296
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,556
I did the same thing to you.

297
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,473
If you're really ready, let's go for it.

298
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,552
I'm crazy about you.
You're right, your husband's gone,

299
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,358
and he's never coming back.

300
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,432
- Who are these lovely people?
- These are my late husband's parents.

301
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,954
<i>Oh, God, how can I make this right?</i>

302
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,118
<i>If only.</i>

303
