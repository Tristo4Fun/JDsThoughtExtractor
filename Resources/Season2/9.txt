1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,989
Oh, thank God!
We were looking all over for you.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,517
Rowdy, bad. I don't know why
he always goes to your door.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,955
- Do you have a stuffed cat?
- Nothing?

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,272
That's 14 times we've done
it to him, and not one laugh.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,555
Mark it up.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,074
Let's get going to Elliot's.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,355
<i>Elliot's dad</i>
<i>cut her off financially.</i>

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,113
<i>Luckily, she's got friends</i>
<i>to rally around her.</i>

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,397
- You got any food?
- How're you holding up, hon?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,879
OK.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,475
Talk about a deluxe
apartment in the sky.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,870
Elliot, it would really suck
to lose this place.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,475
Then again, Elliot,
this place is...

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,198
Is that a Jacuzzi
on your deck?

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,239
Lately, I just feel
like I'm drowning, you know?

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,995
This pear is delicious.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,832
Need help packing?

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,115
<i>As bad as things were</i>
<i>for Elliot...</i>

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,316
Oh, God, that's good.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,630
<i>...they were going</i>
<i>pretty well for me.</i>

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,510
I guarantee you that's a simple
case of cellulitis right there.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,273
Actually, Dr Cox,
I was watching TV last night,

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,113
and they had this special
on flesh-eating bacteria.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,509
Necrotizing fasciitis. Yes?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,716
They called it
flesh-eating bacteria

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,268
to sound more flashy,
hook in all the idiots.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,352
- Apparently it worked.
- Anyhoo, point being,

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,831
they said it was easy to confuse
cellulitis with Chompers.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,711
Chompers was the animated, flesh-eating
bacteria that narrated the special.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,156
Look, Britney, recently I made
the potentially fatal mistake

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,630
of getting back together
with my ex-wife who, angel that she is,

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,109
is carrying the spawn
of another man's seed.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,760
So forgive me if I sound
irritable when I tell you

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,195
I don't care what piece
of irrelevant drivel

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,589
you picked off TV
while you were snuggled up

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,477
in your Holly Hobby PJs.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,676
<i>Come on, trust yourself.</i>

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,796
I think you're wrong.

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,677
Really?

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,116
- Well, I think you're...
- Brilliant!

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,875
Necrotizing fasciitis. That's a
one-in-a-million diagnosis, son.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,155
- One-in-a-million.
- It's nothing, sir.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,037
Anyone could have
made that call.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,873
And yet... they didn't.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
The student becomes
the teacher, eh, Perry?

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,877
- Warms my heart.
- Thank you, sir.

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,431
I don't care about you, son!
I'm trying to do something here.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,796
Rats! He broke my rhythm.

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,793
This is just about the greatest
moment of your life, huh, Newbie?

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,955
<i>Holy crap,</i>
<i>it's David Copperfield.</i>

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,471
Well, definitely top two.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,518
What's that I see in your ear?

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,070
Cool. A coin.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,152
- Do you want it?
- Here, you take it.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,389
Oh, magic!

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,872
- No, top three, top three.
- Oh, God.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,951
<i>By showing up Dr Cox,</i>

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,429
<i>I told the world</i>
<i>I was no longer a child.</i>

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,594
<i>I was the man.</i>

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,240
- Great diagnosis.
- You!

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,629
There's Mr Flesh-Eating
Bacteria, huh?

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,072
Doctor, could you
sign these, please?

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,116
Sure.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,079
"To my two biggest fans..."

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,074
Yeah, they're called "breasts."

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,674
I know. I'm a doctor.

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,274
Eunice, you never
would have made that catch

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,157
if you weren't such a nerd,

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,390
sitting home alone
on a Saturday night,

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,471
watching some
medical special on TV.

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,313
Firstly, in your face,
because it was Friday night.

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,073
Secondly, I would have
made the catch regardless.

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,310
If you use your head
and do some homework,

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,436
medicine is just
basically science.

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,351
Please explain medicine to me,

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,749
because without you
I don't know what to do.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,308
Admitting it is the first step.
Am I right, Ace?

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,709
You are correct, sir!

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,712
That's enough on that one.
We've clearly exhausted it.

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,199
- Hey, stud.
- Hello.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,068
I hear wonder boy spanked
your ass harder than I usually do.

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,392
Such a lucky foetus!
Not another damn word.

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,630
Yeah, I'll say whatever I want.

84
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,518
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,989
Yes, hello? Could we please
get my hormonal,

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,594
extremely annoying
ex-wife's amnio underway?

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,478
I can't wait to write
that down in the baby journal.

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,155
- Could you be a bigger ass?
- Could you have a bigger ass?

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,912
Why does he keep
going back to her?

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,116
Why do people
keep marrying Larry King?

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,760
- He looks like a frog.
- Dr Cox and I go way back.

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,116
I just hate to see him
setting himself up to get hurt.

93
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,919
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Here we go.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,831
What? Where we go?

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,434
You have a habit
of telling other people

96
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,829
how to live their lives
and maybe, possibly,

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,310
sometimes people
don't appreciate it, that's...

98
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,595
- A little.
- Please!

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,752
When do I ever get involved
in people's personal business?

100
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,071
Elliot, listen to me. You have
to sit down and make a budget.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,118
I called my mom today to see
if she could convince my dad

102
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,112
to send some cash, right?
She says I should think of this

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,873
as an opportunity,
then she hung up on me.

104
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,871
- Just like that?
- I may have told her

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,191
she spends more money dyeing
her roots than I do on groceries.

106
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,192
This thing is just as much
her fault as it is my father's.

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,475
Neither one of them
prepared me for this.

108
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,429
Elliot, my dad's an office
supplies salesman, a bad one.

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,432
So things were a little
different for me growing up.

110
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,755
See, this is a bicycle bell.

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,671
Now, you hold onto this,

112
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,196
because I'm gonna give you
a different part every year.

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,352
Maybe after the party
we can take it out for a spin.

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,032
- Great.
- OK?

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,111
Still waiting on that kickstand.

116
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,317
It's just hard for me because
I've always had everything.

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,598
I got used to it. You guys
never had to deal with that.

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,669
Yeah, we're lucky.

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,234
<i>I think patients are like snowflakes.</i>
<i>No two are alike.</i>

120
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,676
We've got two new admissions,
both male, both mid-40s,

121
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,433
both with thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura.

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,988
<i>I bet that snowflake thing</i>
<i>is bogus, too.</i>

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,877
I say we let Super Doc here
take 'em.

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,996
Are you too busy
eating sour grapes?

125
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,755
Oh, look who peeked
in his shorts and found a pair.

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,229
Do you feel like you
finally took on the old man

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,515
in a game of one-on-one
and kicked his ass?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,831
Here's the newsflash there,
Skeech, it was a fluke.

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,957
- I'll do it again.
- All right, fair enough.

130
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,429
Here's your chance.
Two identical patients.

131
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,159
I say we divide 'em up,
just like in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,391
One goes with the se<i>xy</i>,
freewheeling bachelor dad, hello.

133
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,311
The other goes with the neurotic,

134
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,755
sexually-repressed mom,
just you all over.

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,910
And I checked
tonight's TV listings.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,911
There is no special
on that disease,

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,594
so you're gonna wanna stop
at the Blockbuster.

138
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,593
Please, I know all there is
to know about thrombotic...

139
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,434
thrombo cyto... top... toppy...

140
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,273
Thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura.

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,030
Yeah, baby,
just walk right by him.

142
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,951
OK? Just walk right by him.

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

144
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,271
Dr Cox, hi.

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,430
Dammit, I said walk right by him!

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,752
Listen, we just think
that getting back with Jordan

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,513
might be a mistake.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,717
You guys just don't seem to...

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,076
- What am I trying to say, baby?
- I don't know.

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,152
You just don't connect
the way a couple should.

151
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,071
Do you know what I mean?

152
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,152
That pretty much the way
you feel about it there, Gandhi?

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,558
I don't know.

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,551
Interesting.

155
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,117
Mr Bragin, it is so great
to see you back in the hospital.

156
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,715
I got a tube in my penis.

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
You're just a little
dehydrated from the chemo.

158
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,159
Plus, there are no signs
of your pancreatic cancer.

159
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,470
You should be ecstatic.
Nine months ago

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,154
I told you you had eight months
to live. Remember?

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,277
- I vaguely recall that.
- Yeah, of course you do.

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,512
That is totally my fault.
Who knew we could cure cancer?

163
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,034
I prepared myself, you know?

164
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,190
I was really ready.

165
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,998
Yeah.

166
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,719
Dr Reid, have you ever
faced your own mortality?

167
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,439
Before senior prom I tried
to wax my own eyebrows

168
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,590
and took them both clean off.

169
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,749
Yeah.

170
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,192
And by that, I mean "no." Never.

171
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,430
Must have been
a tough time for you.

172
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,431
Sure.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,198
Thanks for starting
the Solumedrol on my TTP patient.

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,669
I'm sorry I'm being
such a pain about this guy.

175
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,638
Dr Cox and I have
this little competition going.

176
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,314
I know that probably
seems insensitive to you...

177
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,233
Sweetheart, you don't have
to explain yourself to me.

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,949
But get your story straight
when you come face-to-face with Jesus.

179
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,276
<i>The chart for Dr Cox's TTP patient.</i>

180
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,830
<i>I could look and see,</i>
<i>but I'm not that insecure about my...</i>

181
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,591
I will get it.

182
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,717
Yes! He's doing
the exact same thing.

183
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,718
<i>When you work in a hospital,</i>
<i>and things are going well,</i>

184
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,917
<i>you should enjoy it,</i>
<i>because around every corner</i>

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,719
<i>there's something waiting</i>
<i>to take it all away.</i>

186
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,509
Dr Reid, I need to talk to you
about your patient, Mr Bragin.

187
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,398
Isn't it great?
He's cancer-free.

188
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,392
Yay! He's suing you
for malpractice.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,712
It's OK. Relax.
I told him how I felt,

190
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,189
he listened,
and nobody got hurt. It's fine.

191
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
Which one of you two's
been messing with my business?

192
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,471
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>every once in a while</i>

193
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,313
<i>you manage</i>
<i>to get away scot-free.</i>

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,038
Hey, Dr Cox.

195
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,317
You'll be happy to know
that I did everything for my patient

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,992
that you did for yours.

197
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,469
My God, I care so little
I almost passed out.

198
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,358
Hey, Ace, your TTP patient coded.
I pronounced him.

199
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,317
- He died?
- I certainly hope so.

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,914
Otherwise that autopsy's
going to be a bitch.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,797
- Boy, that's tough.
- What?

202
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,077
I'd talk you through this,
but I gotta go check on my patient.

203
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,913
You see... He's still alive.

204
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,038
<i>Oh, no.</i>

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,152
How the hell did my patient die?

206
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,993
You started corticosteroids, so did I.

207
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,310
You did plasmapheresis, so did I.

208
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,960
You yelled at Mark the orderly,
so did I.

209
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,393
Hey, Mark.

210
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,994
- See, he's pissed.
- Because his name is Frank.

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,275
Now, as far as your
patient's concerned,

212
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,193
Newbie, I'm afraid you
forgot a very important thing.

213
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,998
<i>For whatever reason</i>
<i>I was fed up.</i>

214
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,277
I've been working my ass off here
for the last year and a half,

215
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,112
and the last thing I need

216
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,714
is another one
of your condescending speeches

217
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,110
where you spoon-feed me some lesson
and call me a girl's name.

218
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,351
Have it your way there,
Carol, cos I'm out.

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,436
- Good luck, everyone.
- Go ahead. Walk away.

220
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,988
Because I'm not gonna
obsess about this.

221
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,834
Can you put a rush on this autopsy?
I gotta figure this out.

222
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,680
You got some crumbs in his hair.

223
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,755
A lawsuit? So you're suing me
because you're not dying?

224
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,230
I didn't want to face my mortality.
You forced me to.

225
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,278
Now I can't earn any money
because my job seems trivial.

226
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,033
I can't be in a relationship,
cos what's the point?

227
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,839
Here's the topper.
Remember my judgmental father

228
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,512
I hadn't spoken to in 15 years?

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,750
Good news, doc,
we've patched things up.

230
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,559
Guess who's coming over
Saturday to watch the game

231
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,232
and tell me what a jerk I am?

232
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,231
You asked how much
time you had left!

233
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,039
- You said I'd be dead by now.
- You're not! So, sue me!

234
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,997
- I am.
- It was a figure of speech.

235
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,911
And your dad
was right about you.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,514
- You tell him yourself.
- Hey, Assface.

237
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,398
Hiya, Pops.

238
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,152
Excuse me, ma'am. Jordan!

239
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,153
Carla has something
she'd like to tell you. Carla.

240
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,912
I didn't mean to upset you,

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,958
even though everything I said
was true and you know it.

242
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,918
Baby, that is a God-awful apology,
just God-awful.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,958
It's cos she's not really sorry.
Honey, I know your type.

244
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,235
It's easy to see
other people's problems

245
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,038
from up there on your pedestal.

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,475
But you better be careful,
cos if you fall off

247
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,358
and have to walk around
down here with the rest of us,

248
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,432
you might catch
a glimpse of yourself in a mirror,

249
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,957
or the surface of a pond,
your boyfriend's gigantic, shiny head,

250
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,191
and trust me, you're not gonna
like what you see.

251
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,272
My head's not...

252
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,954
A little help here!

253
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,555
I'm sorry, kid.
I didn't see anything unusual.

254
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,631
Couldn't he have bled out
or had an MI?

255
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,110
I don't know. I didn't look
for any of those basic things

256
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,111
because I'm horrible at my job.

257
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,997
Dr Walch. <i>Murder She Wrote.</i>

258
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,310
You caught me.
I'm checking on my patient.

259
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,710
- How is that guy doing?
- Not great.

260
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,437
What in the hell
is going on in here?

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,636
The amnio
triggered premature labour.

262
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,915
She's only 24 weeks.
Cut it out right now.

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,991
- Is he yelling at me?
- Yes, he is.

264
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,275
I'm gonna give you
a shot of Terbutaline.

265
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,636
And you know what else?
He said I had a fat ass before.

266
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,029
The nice kind.

267
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,159
Look, I don't get
a lot of women in here.

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,993
What's your honest opinion
of these drapes?

269
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,913
They're fine, Ted.
But I'm getting sued.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,037
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

271
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,633
- Now, by "fine"...
- Ted!

272
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,150
- Just time to calm down now.
- I'm fine.

273
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,071
Actually, I was talking to myself.

274
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,030
Now, you haven't discussed the lawsuit
with Mr Bragin, have you?

275
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,997
A lawsuit?

276
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,310
It sort of came up, yeah.

277
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,110
Oh, God! Tell me
you didn't antagonize him.

278
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,237
- So sue me!
- Or admit fault.

279
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,880
That is totally my fault.

280
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,396
Oh, come on! A good lawyer
couldn't win this case.

281
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,790
New drapes. They're awful.

282
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,998
Dr Kelso, why does
everything keep happening to me?

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,231
Take a breath, Dr Reid.

284
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,836
In and out.
That's it, that's it.

285
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,879
Now, you went
to four years of college

286
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,996
and four years
of medical school,

287
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,675
so I can safely presume
that you are at least eight.

288
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,115
My God, little girl,

289
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,113
grow up and say "how-do"
to the world of modern medicine.

290
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,079
My God. I've been sued four times.

291
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,549
- Ten times.
- Come on, Ted, let's go.

292
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,278
Let's go!

293
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,549
I think you should go in there
and apologize.

294
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,995
No. I didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

295
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,355
I just wanna see if she's OK.

296
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,071
She's fine.

297
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,514
Would you please
have the nurse covering Jordan

298
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,318
page me the moment she wakes up?

299
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,799
- Sure.
- Thank you.

300
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,552
Hey, Dr Cox, I'm sorry.

301
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,029
I was frustrated before,
so now I'm here,

302
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,509
why don't you tell me what I forgot?

303
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,956
- Can I? Really?
- Sure. Hit me.

304
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,838
- How about go to hell, Shakira?
- What?

305
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,310
Now you've decided you're ready
to listen, how does it work?

306
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,915
Gonna pull a string on my back?
Step right up and give it a tug.

307
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,072
But I bet it keeps coming up,
"Go to hell, Shakira."

308
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,116
Why do you always
have to be like that?

309
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,192
I try harder than anyone
and you never give me any credit.

310
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,429
You listen to me.

311
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,751
I'm not doing this because I get
my jollies being your mentor,

312
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,229
and I'm not doing it
so years from now I can say,

313
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,912
"Boy, I knew him when."

314
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,391
I'm doing it because if I don't,
people would die.

315
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,630
Thanks for your help.

316
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,751
You know what, Mr Bragin?
I figured something out.

317
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,559
- That damn nurse broke my bed.
- That's just it.

318
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,076
You blame everyone else for anything
that goes wrong. Like this.

319
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,277
The nurse didn't break your bed.
You just press this button.

320
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,952
All right, it is broken.

321
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,190
If you hate your job,
switch careers.

322
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,158
If you can't get a relationship,
you have problems.

323
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,037
And I know I'm right. I'm the same.

324
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,190
I blame my parents
for not preparing me,

325
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,510
this hospital
for taking up all of my time.

326
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,194
I'm even blaming you
for jeopardizing my future.

327
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,589
But you know what?
It's time for me to grow up

328
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,796
and start holding
myself accountable.

329
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,270
- And I'm doing it.
- Good for you.

330
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,796
You're still suing me, aren't you?

331
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,678
Yeah, but I feel like now
you'll be able to handle it.

332
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,315
You know what?
We're just gonna have to get him fixed.

333
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,595
Good news is,
he doesn't need to go to a vet.

334
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,875
We could just pop
these things right off.

335
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,033
Yes! Baby,
you have got to tell JD,

336
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,951
because he is not gonna believe it.

337
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,632
Jordan was right about me.

338
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,393
I'm insecure and I judge
people to cover up for it.

339
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,391
Even right now,
all I can think about

340
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,311
is to tell you
you're a surgeon now,

341
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,472
and you have to start
acting like an adult.

342
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,118
You had to say all of that?

343
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,998
You don't listen unless
people spell it out for you.

344
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,640
- Oh, my God, I can't stop.
- Baby...

345
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,915
Maybe it's something
you need to work on.

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,675
I promise you, I will never ever
tell you what to do, ever again.

347
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,833
Yeah, you will. But with me
it's OK, because I love you.

348
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,950
Besides, I barely listen anyway.

349
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,794
C'mon, Rowdy. Let's go, boy.
Let's head up the fourth floor.

350
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,554
Whoa! Whoa, boy!

351
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,914
Slow down!

352
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,557
<i>As I sat there, searching</i>
<i>for answers about my patient,</i>

353
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,679
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>I still needed Dr Cox.</i>

354
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,433
<i>It's hard to face a harsh truth</i>
<i>about yourself.</i>

355
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,598
<i>The only thing you can do</i>
<i>is try to take positive steps.</i>

356
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,594
<i>Unfortunately, it's hard</i>
<i>to take positive steps</i>

357
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,717
<i>when you've burned the bridge</i>
<i>you need to walk across.</i>

358
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,791
It was luck.

359
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,553
- What?
- The thing that you forgot.

360
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,234
Turns out, whatever
you know about medicine,

361
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,709
ultimately luck or fate or God

362
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,030
or who knows what
is always gonna end up

363
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,590
playing a much bigger role
than you and I ever will.

364
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,672
It was lucky you were watching
that show the other night,

365
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,991
and it was unlucky
that your patient went the other way,

366
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,355
even though you did
everything right,

367
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,476
and for the record, you did.

368
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,553
I was looking over your shoulder
every step of the way.

369
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,679
- Thanks.
- It wasn't a favour, Newbie.

370
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,512
It was my job.

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
