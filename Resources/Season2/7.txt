1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>As a doctor, you learn</i>
<i>to use anything you can</i>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,035
<i>to keep a patient</i>
<i>from getting hurt again.</i>

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,156
So, Mike, before we
get you out of here,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,959
I think it's important we go
over this one more time.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,235
<i>Even their own home video.</i>

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,880
See, right about here
is where you get hurt.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,431
See, here you're not hurt.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,909
And then.. Oh, good God!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,831
Hurt again.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,388
Not hurt... hurt.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,995
Baritone. Soprano.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,116
Married with two kids.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,031
- Dying old...
- Look, I get it, OK?

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,157
OK. OK, Mike.
That's all that matters.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,440
Victor. Victoria.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,034
I mean, the kid thinks
he's Evil Knievel.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,271
Gosh, I'd love to attend
your safety camp this summer,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,557
I would, but my parents are making me
go to Maine with them.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,596
Make sure you take
a lot of pictures.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,477
When you get back,
we can sit down

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,915
and make our "friends forever" collage.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,911
Come on, now.
The kid's 16 years old.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,309
He's a little busted up.
It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,118
I mean, hell,
when you were a kid,

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,589
you must have cut your hand
on your dollhouse.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,797
Oh, please. I lived for danger.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,395
Who's ready for some Frisbee?

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,630
Get my mom! Get my mom!

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,792
I had four different helmets.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,519
I don't have time right
now to be the 100-watt bulb

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,592
for your annoying little moth,
so if you could fly away,

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,911
that'd be great,
just fly...

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
<i>I usually don't walk away</i>
<i>from Dr Cox,</i>

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,675
<i>but today</i>
<i>the pharmaceutical reps show up</i>

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,352
<i>to peddle their new drugs,</i>

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,238
<i>and at Sacred Heart</i>
<i>that means one thing.</i>

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,878
<i>Julie's here.</i>

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,433
Damn.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,919
Damn.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,752
Damn.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,308
- What? She's hot.
- No, that's hot.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,470
Baby, you know
that fantasy I have

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,755
of you, me, and a player
to be named later?

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,594
Yeah, I'm fine. If it was
someone like her, I'd go for it.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,719
You are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,995
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,719
It's not like he's gonna
do anything about it.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,315
I was wondering if there was
any way that we could possibly...

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,153
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, baby.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,313
Yeah, you can't ever
give a guy that window.

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,995
<i>Even though she was</i>
<i>way out of my league,</i>

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,676
<i>I decided to show some guts</i>
<i>and lay down the smoothest rap I knew.</i>

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,350
Hi, handsome. I'm Julie.

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,072
Were you named
after a precious jewel...ie?

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,948
You are cute.
Would you like a pen?

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,828
No. I'd love one.

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,559
Well, go ahead, take it.

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,950
<i>Steady. Easy now.</i>

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,634
<i>You're almost there.</i>

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,836
That's a bad Newbie.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,276
My God, you'd be more subtle
if you stood naked in the hallway

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,555
eating a ten-inch kielbasa.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,471
That hurts, Perry.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,630
- Let's go.
- But I gotta say,

65
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,154
I don't mind watching
you two boys walk away.

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,391
Oh yeah! Work it.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,677
She means our tushies.
We go back, but walk backwards.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,230
There is no one I hate
more than that Medusa.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,074
Even knowing she's here makes me
want to tear someone's head off.

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,993
Is this a good time?
I have a teeny-weeny question

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,275
about Mrs Kahn's
necrotizing fasciitis.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,749
- For you, Barbie, anything.
- Super.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,671
First, an interesting side note.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,991
I had my physical last week,
and while my cholesterol was low,

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,389
my blood pressure
was through the roof.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,789
Needless to say,
my physician was stumped.

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,270
But now, thank God,
you've helped to solve that riddle,

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,874
because the instant
I heard your shrill voice

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,349
whining about
a "teeny-weeny problem,"

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,795
it took every ounce
of self-restraint I had

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,678
to keep blood
from shooting out my ears.

82
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,557
In the time
it took you to say that,

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,278
you could have just
helped me.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,911
Well, yes, it does, but here,
that's what makes it delicious.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,515
What? I am not gonna say a word.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,955
- You just did.
- Except that, and that.

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,031
And that and that and that.

88
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,236
It just keeps on going.

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,840
Hey, cutie. What's your name?

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,071
I'm Carla, your girlfriend,
and as much as I usually love it,

91
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,756
I really don't have time
to pretend we never met, OK?

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,070
Carla's a pretty name.

93
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,311
You know I'd play, sweetie,
but because I'm just a nurse,

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,437
I have to go get Dr Wilder's
permission to give his patient

95
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,590
some food even though
I know it's fine.

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,355
Speaking of things
that are perfectly fine...

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,238
That was a compliment.
Why won't any women talk to me?

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,596
You're slimy and turn everything
into a double entendre.

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,591
Not true.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,629
Go ahead.

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,678
I'd like to double her entendre.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,193
Please?

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,152
<i>He's leaving.</i>

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,959
<i>This is officially</i>
<i>the greatest day ever.</i>

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,632
Taking off?

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,110
- Yeah. If that's OK.
- That's fine.

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,430
I just wanted
to sneak out for an hour

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,398
and see my kid's fourth-grade play,
but you caught me.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,835
- No. No catchies.
- No, I think you're right.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,673
Before I do anything,
I'll run it by you first.

111
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,796
Permission to go see
my kid's attempt

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,711
to overcome
his crippling shyness

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,916
by appearing
in his class's production

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,117
- of <i>Town without a Turkey?</i>
- I gotta get back to work.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,239
Back to work. Message received.

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,959
<i>What just happened?</i>

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,395
I can't figure out
what to do about Mrs Kahn.

118
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,789
I don't know if I should
send her to surgery.

119
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,075
Well, don't send her to surgery.

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,390
I'll tell you what you do,
you wait and see.

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,677
I know I'm right because
I'm a wait-and-see kind of guy.

122
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,796
You know, Elliot,
in modern medicine,

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,235
we're often faced
with tough decisions.

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,436
- You are amazing.
- Well...

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,397
"Amazing" is sort of
a strong word.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,040
I just show up and let the Lord
work through me.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,839
You think you're a better doctor
than me, don't you?

128
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,115
<i>Well, I do have</i>
<i>better bedside manner.</i>

129
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,714
<i>I anticipate problems</i>
<i>way ahead of time.</i>

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,997
<i>Oh, and my hair never gets</i>
<i>in my face. So, yes, yes, I do.</i>

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,071
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

132
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,833
Every time you stare off
into space like this...

133
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,878
you're thinking of something
you're too afraid to say.

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,758
Please, I never do this.

135
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,434
<i>Maybe she's upset</i>
<i>because she knows I'm right.</i>

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,750
Oh, my God.

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,713
Dr Cox, I hate to bring it up again,
but it seems important.

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,268
Julie likes our tushies.

139
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,954
Newbie, any doctor with
a shred of self-respect

140
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,713
wouldn't give that woman
the time of day.

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,553
- Oh, Julie.
- Well, well.

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,359
If it isn't the Captain
& Tenille of the underworld.

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,317
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Julie.

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,038
Perry, do you know the name

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,396
of the new anti-arrhythmic drug
that Julie is selling?

146
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,199
- That's a tough one.
- It's Plomox.

147
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,078
Nice work, Nancy Drew.
Now see if you can solve the one

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,230
about the missing ID badge.

149
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,039
Plomox is the most effective
anti-arrhythmic drug

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,554
on the market,
and it has minimal side effects,

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,915
only nausea, impotence,
and anal leakage.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,719
I'm getting two out of three
from the conversation.

153
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,633
You kids can talk more
over the pharmaceutical dinner

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,790
that you're helping her
put together.

155
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,475
- Don't do this to me, Bob.
- Do it to him, Bob.

156
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,028
Perry, we're going to need
a big staff turnout,

157
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,917
so don't take "no"
for an answer.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,752
- You going there, chief?
- No.

159
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,593
If I wanted to make
small talk over low-grade beef,

160
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,989
I'd have dinner at home.

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm just increasing
your Lidocaine drip

162
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,149
just a little bit, OK,
Mr Brooks?

163
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,596
- Hey, Carla, you got a second?
- No, actually, I'm swamped.

164
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,591
I got a present for you.

165
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,192
Why would you get me a present?

166
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,748
Why does it need to be
a birthday or anniversary

167
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,559
for me to get my baby
a little something-something?

168
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,596
Plus you figured
you'd get yourself

169
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,989
a little at-work
something-something.

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,071
I'll get the door.

171
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,148
Wow. A bus pass.

172
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,152
- Help me get off my bra.
- That's not all.

173
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,232
You'll use that bus pass
for an all-expense paid trip

174
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,117
to nurse practitioners' school,

175
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,873
where you'll learn how to be
more than just a nurse.

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,599
- "Just a nurse?"
- Did I say "just a nurse?"

177
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,352
I meant a nurse.

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,715
You were complaining
about having to ask

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,597
for permission
to feed a patient.

180
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,399
You'll have more responsibility,
make more money,

181
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,869
- so I thought...
- You thought the only reason

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,155
I've done my job
for the last eight years

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,152
is because nobody came along
to hand me a brochure?

184
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,471
And a bus pass.

185
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,994
You're unbelievable.

186
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,357
Damn.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,353
Dude, I am just as disappointed
as you are.

188
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,198
JD, even though I decided
to send Mrs Kahn to surgery,

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,953
I know you were trying
to help me in your own way.

190
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,352
I overreacted. That's something I'm
working on in therapy to not do as much.

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,431
I still think
you should have gone with

192
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,069
- my wait-and-see approach.
- You're not the boss of me!

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,231
I'm not the boss of anyone.

194
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,072
Permission to use the can, boss?

195
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,310
Enough already.
I'm not doing this.

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,877
Fine. Permission granted.

197
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,110
So, Mr Brooks
is doing peachy, huh?

198
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,033
- Peachy keen.
- Great.

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,157
A patient's improvement
is always cause for celebration

200
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,118
here at Sacred Heart,
and yet, for some reason,

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,031
I'm not wearing a party hat,

202
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,590
sitting bare-ass on
the hospital's copier machine.

203
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,399
You know why? It's not
because I have the name

204
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,438
"Johnny" tattooed on my butt.
He's an old sailor buddy

205
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,432
and if you went through
what we did, you'd understand.

206
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,909
It's because somebody went ahead

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,434
and increased Mr Brooks's
Lidocaine drip,

208
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,557
and by law
that could only be a doctor.

209
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,069
Are you a doctor,
Nurse Espinoza?

210
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,712
Well?

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,076
- No, sir.
- You're damn right you're not.

212
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,359
So how's the guest list for tonight's
steak dinner shaping up?

213
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,228
Well, now, I don't have
any definitive confirmations yet,

214
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,551
but admittedly that could be
because I haven't asked anyone.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,518
Why does it have to be like this
every time I come here?

216
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,636
I mean, what is
your problem with me?

217
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,790
OK, well,

218
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,031
for starters, everyone here
knows that you sell pills,

219
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,793
and yet you use phrases
like "take orally"

220
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,236
and "increases blood flow"
way, way too much.

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,756
I mean, jeepers, Julie, you have
half the doctors on this staff

222
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,910
believing that if they
join Team Plomox

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,798
that they get an outside shot
of you showing them

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,757
the cotton inside your bottle.

225
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,152
Would you like to know
the real dirty, dirty little secret?

226
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,073
It's that your drug is so good
that you guys went ahead

227
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,435
and put about
a 600% mark-up on it.

228
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,557
But the only ones who get
hurt are the sick people, right?

229
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,949
Since your company
doesn't care about them

230
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,396
and you're part of the system,
that means you don't care either.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,233
That's what's making me sick.
That's all.

232
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,198
Well, you can say
what you want, Perry,

233
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,669
but we both know
that you'd love nothing more

234
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,832
than to smack this fine ass.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,672
Perry.

236
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,591
Harder, Perry.

237
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,633
Don't stop, Perry.

238
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,918
Oh, Perry,
that feels good.

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,360
So you promise me you're gonna
be more careful?

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,193
Dude, the only way to feel
alive is to push the limits

241
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,078
- once in a while, you know?
- Well, keep it real.

242
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,073
God. See ya, geek.

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,071
Buy a cup!

244
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,515
What's wrong?

245
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,795
Mrs Kahn died
on the operating table.

246
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,512
<i>A lot of things</i>
<i>can take you by surprise.</i>

247
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,232
<i>Sometimes it's just realizing that</i>
<i>you're not as happy as you thought.</i>

248
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,311
<i>Sometimes it's a hot chick</i>
<i>smacking her tushie.</i>

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,199
<i>And sometimes it's when</i>
<i>you take a chance... and lose.</i>

250
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,397
This just sucks, you know?

251
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,678
<i>This is a crucial moment.</i>
<i>Pick your words carefully.</i>

252
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,830
I guess I was right after all.

253
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,711
Stupid.

254
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,794
<i>I had to talk to Elliot before the</i>
<i>morbidity and mortality conference,</i>

255
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,552
<i>Nothing puts you</i>
<i>in a worse mood</i>

256
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,029
<i>than having to explain</i>
<i>why your patient died.</i>

257
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,712
<i>I just need to talk to her</i>

258
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,792
<i>when there's no possible way</i>
<i>that she can interrupt me.</i>

259
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,395
<i>Peanut-butter cracker!</i>
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

260
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,392
What I said earlier came
out completely the wrong way

261
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,550
and I just want you to know
that I act...

262
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,756
Bite me.

263
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,913
Oh, she's a crafty lass.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,197
Baby, I know you had a rough day,
and I was part of it.

265
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,910
I thought I'd make it up to you
by taking you out to a nice dinner.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
Which waitress
do you think will do me?

267
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,473
I'd say you got a shot
with the busboy over there.

268
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,755
You realize
this doesn't count, right?

269
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,958
Yeah, but, baby... Free steak.

270
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,590
You just flat out
get women, don't you?

271
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,831
- This is kind of romantic, right?
- Check it out.

272
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,593
It's a meat cookie.

273
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,238
Oh, God!

274
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,073
Hello, boys and girl.
So, how's the food?

275
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,188
Free.

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,316
And how are you, Dr Cox?

277
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,231
I'm just here to enjoy my meal,

278
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,995
so unless those things dispense
A1 Sauce, I'd keep moving.

279
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,755
That is so, so funny.
You know what else is funny?

280
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,229
How you claim you want
nothing to do with me,

281
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,754
yet every time I turn around,
there you are.

282
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,112
I wonder why that is?

283
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,511
Oh, that feels good.

284
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,639
Finally, we have Dr Reid's
necrotizing fasciitis case.

285
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,350
Deceased. Now, don't be frightened,
sweetheart. No one's on trial here.

286
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,671
At least not until the family
sues your little behind.

287
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,396
Sweetie, I'm not joking.

288
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,631
But should that happen,
you may rest assured

289
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,518
that the hospital
will stand behind you 100 per cent.

290
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,195
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Now, see, there I was joking.

291
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,998
Try to keep up.

292
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,991
<i>Oh, God, this is painful.</i>

293
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,719
<i>It's like watching a shark</i>
<i>circle a baby harp seal.</i>

294
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,598
Dr Reid faced
a very difficult decision

295
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,037
and she chose
an extremely risky course.

296
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,112
<i>He's like a royal python</i>
<i>torturing a hopper mouse.</i>

297
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,031
<i>Man, I love</i> Animal Planet.

298
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,556
I believe we all have a lesson
to learn from Dr Reid's case.

299
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,710
<i>And here comes</i>
<i>the crushing blow.</i>

300
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,315
I say...kudos to Dr Reid.

301
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,550
What-os to who?

302
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,997
Without surgery, her patient didn't
have a Popsicle's chance in hell.

303
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,359
By making the tough choice, she at least
gave Mrs Kahn an honest shot.

304
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,111
Now, for all of you wait-and-see
doctors out there...

305
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,471
...if you do not
get to the point

306
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,233
where you have the courage
to take risks,

307
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,788
you will never be a great doctor.

308
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,831
- Never?
- Never ever.

309
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,629
Turk, don't eat off my plate.

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,109
You're right, baby.
I'm sorry. That's rude.

311
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,275
So you're having steak
with a side of steak?

312
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,999
That's right, turf and turf.

313
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,117
You know what?
I'm on my second glass of good wine,

314
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,590
I'm watching my boyfriend
try to eat his body weight in meat,

315
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,511
and I am extremely tickled

316
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,751
that the only thing Dr Cox
wants isn't on the menu.

317
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,432
- What?
- What can I say?

318
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,511
I'm finally having a good time.

319
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,989
- That'll pass.
- I still think it's lame

320
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,152
that you didn't like Turk's
nurse-practitioner present.

321
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,993
- Dude.
- Told you.

322
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,995
Hey, Elliot, I'm sorry
that I was such a jerk before,

323
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,548
but, hey, I got mine, right?

324
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,998
Anyway, thanks
for being classier than I am

325
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,911
and not rubbing it in my face.

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,037
No problem.
Hey, you never told me that

327
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,510
- you're part Native American.
- What are you talking about?

328
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,876
Aren't you a member
of the Waitensee tribe?

329
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,428
Come on! I laughed so hard
when I thought of that

330
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,431
that I peed a little.

331
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,871
I changed right after.

332
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,836
Why wouldn't you want a better job?

333
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,595
Hold up. My baby's happy
with being just a nurse.

334
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,717
Did I say "just a nurse"?
Nobody at this table said "just."

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,837
I meant "a nurse."
Right, baby?

336
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,035
That's right.

337
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,192
Why?

338
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,794
Oh, just not smart.
Even for you.

339
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,158
Excuse me for not having
all your male ambition.

340
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,800
I can't believe anyone
would look down on me

341
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,158
because I'm good at what I do
and because I love doing it.

342
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,393
- I'm sick to my stomach.
- Me too, Turk. Me too.

343
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,632
No, baby, I'm serious.
I think I'm in trouble here.

344
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,199
Baby?

345
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,395
Permission to speak, sir?

346
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,630
You know what? No.
No, you may not speak.

347
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,917
Not now and not ever, OK?
You have overplayed your hand

348
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,877
and you may never
talk to me again.

349
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,713
Those are the rules
of the game.

350
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,631
Then I quit.

351
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,599
No, no, no quitsies. Checkmate,
gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.

352
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,070
You know, my son used to love
to play Yahtzee with me,

353
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,391
until you made me skip his play.
Now he won't eat.

354
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,675
We've started a new game now,
haven't we?

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,912
Yeah, it's called "You don't eat
until Timmy does."

356
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,639
My mechanic has that poster
in his garage.

357
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,234
Does he have this one?

358
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,437
Actually,
it's a family business.

359
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,830
So, here we are.

360
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,592
Two people,

361
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,591
street lamp,

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,795
full moon.

363
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,552
Guy pissing on the dumpster.

364
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,110
Oh, did I break the mood?

365
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,434
Fine, you want me
to drop the flirty crap?

366
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,637
I'm interested in you.

367
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,712
I think we're a lot alike,
I think we have chemistry,

368
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,189
and I think you're scared,
so you use what I do

369
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,635
as an excuse
not to give us a try.

370
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,030
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

371
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,873
You OK?

372
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,111
Look at that. I bounced back.

373
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,399
Baby, my stomach's gonna explode.

374
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,199
It's only heartburn,
sweetie. You'll be fine.

375
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,877
- How's meathead?
- I know I'm not a doctor,

376
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,077
but if you order a strong anti-emetic,
that'd be great.

377
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,914
You would ace that nurse
practitioners program.

378
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,276
Really? You think so?

379
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,316
What if the classes
are too hard?

380
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,676
What if the teachers are mean,
if the other kids don't like me?

381
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,557
- OK.
- I would ace that program.

382
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,154
But I barely get to see
my boyfriend as it is.

383
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,358
And if I went to class
five nights a week, well...

384
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,750
I guess I'm taking my chances
on Turk right now.

385
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,549
- Him?
- Somebody make it stop.

386
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,997
I just don't want to look back
and wonder what could have been.

387
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,640
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

388
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,391
How's it going?

389
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,311
You have more jokes, don't you?

390
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,630
I jotted a couple of things down.

391
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,792
You see that nurse over there?
I love her.

392
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,515
Every night at 10.30
for the last year,

393
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,273
I've watched her come in here
and get a cup of coffee

394
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,716
and not once have I had the courage
to even ask her her name.

395
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,429
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
she has a snaggletooth.

396
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,750
The point is,
Kelso's right, you know.

397
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,751
It's not even
just professionally.

398
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,957
In my personal life,
I don't take any chances either.

399
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,713
I want to. I just...

400
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,678
I can never seem
to take that first step.

401
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,231
- Come here.
- What?

402
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,232
- Come on.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

403
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,788
I wanna spend time
with Snaggletooth.

404
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,476
<i>I guess it all comes down</i>
<i>to what we're willing to risk.</i>

405
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,915
<i>For some of us,</i>
<i>it's our feelings.</i>

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,911
Wanna talk?

407
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,791
No.

408
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,438
<i>For others, it's our future.</i>

409
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,873
Baby.

410
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,110
If I had to do it again,
I would.

411
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,590
- Cos I love the steak.
- I know, popi.

412
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,830
I know.

413
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,993
<i>For me, it was taking</i>
<i>a risk, period.</i>

414
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,197
<i>Even if that meant starting</i>
<i>with my very first step.</i>

415
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,840
- You're gonna love this.
- I don't wanna do it.

416
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,956
What's the worst
that could happen?

417
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,235
- We could die!
- OK, the second worse?

418
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,515
Can't we just go
and talk to Snaggletooth?

419
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,589
No. Here we go.

420
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,636
One, two, three!

421
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
