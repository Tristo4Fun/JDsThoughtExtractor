1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,676
<i>Work's different now</i>
<i>I'm a resident. I feel more confident,</i>

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,353
<i>more like a, hell,</i>
<i>I'll say it, a doctor.</i>

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,758
Good morning, people.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,033
- You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
- I work here.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,508
Doesn't change
the fact you're gonna be fine.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,035
Why in the hell
are you wearing a coat?

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,837
Cos I'm a doctor.

8
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,752
Babs, if you're worried
about people seeing your ass,

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,309
do what all the other girls do
and tie a sweater around your waist.

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,593
I look doctorly.

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,149
You look like the guy who buys
a bronze star, pins it to his lapel

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,313
and tells everyone to call him Sarge.
Nobody likes that guy. Not a soul.

13
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,797
- I was in the military.
- Where did you come from?

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,076
If I find out you're wearing a bronzy
without having served,

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,354
I'll make things
uncomfortable for you.

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,748
<i>Coat-wearing doctors</i>
<i>do not take this crap.</i>

17
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,672
- You were never in the military.
- Yes, I was.

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,468
- Which branch?
- The janitor branch.

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,958
I'm watching you.

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,190
That's right, Sasquatch.

21
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,713
<i>You see, things have changed.</i>

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,957
<i>We've begun to adapt to new situations.</i>

23
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,392
My back is on fire.

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,472
If Dr Amato was any shorter, I'd be
passing him instruments with my feet.

25
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,470
Dr Turk, I need you down here.

26
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,151
Coming down.

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,356
<i>Even other people</i>
<i>are starting to see us differently.</i>

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,509
Hey there, Doctor.

29
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,159
Oh, me? Of course,
because I'm a doctor.

30
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,831
I've got the outfit.

31
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:30,911
I've got the heart-hearing thingy.

32
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,194
Stethoscope.

33
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:36,316
Paging Dr Know-it-all to the cafeteria.

34
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,990
Oh, sweet baby James.

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,628
<i>Most importantly, we've started</i>
<i>to treat each other with respect.</i>

36
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,471
Dude, you're such a loser, man.

37
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,676
I look spiffy. I'm trying
to separate myself from the pack.

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,115
You already have. You're the biggest
geek to come through here.

39
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,598
- Yeah.
- Don't laugh.

40
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,512
- You're a frat boy with a back problem.
- Yeah, I am.

41
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,271
Oh, do me, do me, do me!

42
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,998
Be careful about yelling
that out in a bar.

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,671
You guys get to be something.

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,910
The Dork, Jock, firecracker
from the School of Hard Knocks.

45
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,832
No offence, Carla. Damn it, what am I?

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,989
- You're white.
- The whitest.

47
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,991
- Yeah, you are.
- Oh, come on. JD's white.

48
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,072
I ain't hearing that woman
cos I'm talking to him.

49
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,190
OK, it's a tie.

50
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,390
T-Diddy?

51
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,314
You got me in the ICU for a cold?

52
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:46,709
Mr Blair, you have a sinus infection
with orbital extension.

53
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,189
You were admitted delirious
from your 106-degree temperature,

54
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,918
naked and very adamant
about staying that way.

55
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,638
- I was hot.
- I'll second that.

56
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,837
- Sharp coat, sport.
- Yeah, it's spiffy.

57
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,672
Shocker! You care more
about appearances...

58
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,910
Finish that thought quickly.
I'm not breaking my gait.

59
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,911
...substance, style,
what's important, coat, not...

60
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:13,753
- Too slow.
- I think you really got through to him.

61
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,317
My God, you hear like a bat.

62
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,316
<i>Idiot. I wish I had a guy that would</i>
<i>stop me before I did something stupid.</i>

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,514
<i>Mistake!</i>

64
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,990
<i>I don't know why he's an opera singer.</i>

65
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,991
Listen, Tiny Dancer,
I wouldn't be flapping my mouth

66
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,752
if I'd forgotten
to get a blood culture on Mr Blair.

67
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:45,468
And for the love of God, do you at least
remember what you were doing

68
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,868
the day they were passing out
common sense?

69
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,551
Maybe you were running late

70
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,076
cos you couldn't find the right thong
for those low-rider jeans you love.

71
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,710
Maybe you were bopping along to
whatever boy band makes your heart race

72
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,950
and you just drove on by.
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

73
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,236
But one thing's sure.
You wound up at the dumb-dumb store

74
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,312
and put about as much of that
in the car as you could fit, didn't you?

75
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,789
<i>And then I did something</i>
<i>I've never done before.</i>

76
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,792
If you flipped the page you'd see
that I pan cultured him yesterday,

77
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,952
but that would spoil the pleasure you
take in pointing out people's slip-ups.

78
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,234
Too bad, Buster Brown,
I'm a resident now,

79
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,629
I'm not gonna make the same
intern mistakes I made last year.

80
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,075
I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
yell at me in front of my patient.

81
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,512
Buster Brown?

82
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,638
<i>Focus all energy on lip not quivering.</i>

83
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,398
- How's the back, sweetness?
- Perfect.

84
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,916
I'm sorry the last couple of nights
I haven't given you the Turkey-Jerky,

85
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:49,594
but rest assured your man will be back
in action before you know it.

86
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,112
You take your time.

87
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,397
Hey, big fella, we're together
on a thyroidectomy this afternoon.

88
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,516
- Could be a long one.
- Oh, that's great, Dr Amato.

89
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,993
- How was that not funny?
- I don't know, dude.

90
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,673
You guys are getting to be
like Starsky and Hutch.

91
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,592
If Starsky was a ventriloquist
and Hutch was a puppet.

92
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,318
I would watch that.
Why do you keep getting him?

93
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,074
The other surgeons are busting my chops
for skipping guys' night out.

94
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,751
Dr Amato's your punishment?

95
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,115
No, I enjoy needing you to lower me
on the toilet in the morning.

96
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,188
Check that out.

97
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,077
<i>It looks innocent,</i>
<i>but Elliot was late this morning.</i>

98
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,754
<i>Once you've been here a while,</i>
<i>you learn to read between the lines.</i>

99
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,431
Mrs Bumbry, I wish I had better news,
but you didn't qualify

100
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,636
for the GI clinical trials,
so we'll keep plugging away.

101
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,233
Great. So how was the sex with that guy?

102
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,752
What guy? I wasn't... I...

103
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,798
Elliot, I have other patients, Mrs
Bumbry needs a nap. We're all very busy.

104
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:04,598
I've never done anything like this.
I just met him and slept with him.

105
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,397
God, I miss one-night stands.

106
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,277
The best thing was,
since I knew it was just a fling,

107
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:12,317
I wasn't afraid to ask him
for exactly what I wanted.

108
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,108
- Which was?
- Shirt on, lights off, no talking.

109
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,032
Well, you just be careful.

110
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:23,795
You wouldn't believe how quickly a
reputation can be made in this hospital.

111
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,870
You're a bit of slut, aren't you?

112
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,269
As soon as we get out
of this sterile field,

113
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:40,955
I am going to need the man
who hit that to hit that.

114
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,438
Wait a minute, I'm Elliot Reid.

115
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,148
People, listen up,
this rumour ends right now.

116
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,833
She slept with him
and she hardly knew him.

117
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,548
- Does that happen a lot around here?
- Not enough.

118
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,155
That infection keeps hanging around,

119
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,914
so I want to put you on a broader-
spectrum antibiotic intravenously.

120
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,398
But I'm feeling better.

121
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,995
I'm gonna tell you something my mom
used to tell me when I was scared.

122
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,435
In the case of sinus infection
not responding to antibiotics,

123
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,309
the recommended protocol
is imipenem, 500 mg, IVQ, six hours.

124
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,436
Got me through a lot of hard times.

125
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,271
<i>I love it that Mr Blair trusted me.</i>

126
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,715
<i>It's one of the best feelings</i>
<i>you can have as a doctor.</i>

127
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,313
- How's it going?
- You can't wear that.

128
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,789
- You mean after Labour Day?
- You know what I mean.

129
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,155
It's a white coat.
Anybody can wear a white coat.

130
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,155
Jerk.

131
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,469
You're what we call "a goner."

132
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,310
I'm kidding. There's nothing here.

133
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,510
So Mrs Bumbry here
has inflammatory bowel disease, huh?

134
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,909
And the drug they're testing
at the clinical trial could help.

135
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,752
But she doesn't qualify.
You OK, Mrs Bumbry?

136
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,949
I liked Bow Wow
when he was Lil' Bow Wow.

137
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,109
Rappers, they grow up so fast.

138
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,398
If you're gonna survive in medicine,
you've gotta accept rules are rules.

139
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,595
Anyone from that
clinical trial around?

140
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:26,230
Hello! Hello! This lady's
supposed to be in this trial.

141
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,708
- OK.
- What the hell did you just do?

142
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,553
When you speak of this, and
I know you will, could I be shirtless?

143
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,348
I think it would be even more
impressive if I was shirtless.

144
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,516
If you're a criminal,
even if you aren't afraid of Starsky,

145
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,672
if a Hutch puppet jumps out at you,
"Freeze, sucker!" you're done for.

146
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,636
Does it have a real gun or puppet gun?

147
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:51,997
- Puppet gun. They'd sew it to his hand.
- OK. I'd watch that.

148
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,034
What's up, fellas?

149
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:01,352
<i>I don't care what hospital you go to,</i>
<i>surgery is still a boys' club.</i>

150
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,109
<i>I'm just as cool as those guys.</i>

151
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,114
Bye, Turk.

152
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,508
T-Dog, settle a medical debate for us.

153
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,238
I think Elliot's
got a modest rack at best.

154
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:20,347
But my favourite attending here
says when he was tuning in Tokyo,

155
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,509
the reception was excellent.

156
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,875
Elliot's a friend of mine,
so I don't want to talk about that.

157
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,757
So, Dr Turk, how is your back?

158
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,992
My back's as swollen
as Elliot's big-ass breasts.

159
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,111
- I was paged.
- Patient's complaining of anosmia.

160
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:46,155
Anosmia?

161
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,914
I always thought it was very funny
that losing your sense of smell

162
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,718
was called anosmia.

163
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,554
Anosmia, you know, like Schnozmia.
Don't you find that very funny?

164
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,310
- He doesn't.
- I'm calling Dr Cox.

165
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,755
- Nobody needs to call Dr Cox.
- This is only temporary, right?

166
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,629
Of course it's temporary.
Could also be slightly more untemporary.

167
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,630
You mean permanent.

168
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,992
<i>Just when you think</i>
<i>you have this place figured out,</i>

169
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,671
<i>it finds a new way to get you.</i>

170
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,636
I'm waiting.

171
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,430
Unfortunately, you've
put us in somewhat of a legal bind.

172
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,671
Way to go, Ted. Good God, man,
you couldn't scare a child.

173
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,477
Who would want to?

174
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,075
Do you have any idea how much money
this hospital makes from that GI trial

175
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,627
into which you enrolled your patient?

176
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,392
I'm gonna go ahead and guess $ 7.

177
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,310
<i>Sometimes it comes right at you.</i>

178
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,959
Keep smiling, tough guy.
First I'm gonna...

179
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,351
Finish that thought, Bobcat,
cos I'm not breaking my gait.

180
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,913
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

181
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,228
<i>Sometimes it sneaks up on you.</i>

182
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,470
When she dated JD, she'd just wear
a T-shirt in the morning.

183
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,232
So every time
she reached up high for the cereal,

184
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,628
everybody got two scoops
of booty flakes.

185
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:10,951
The two scoops, they were packed
with flavour. You know what I'm saying?

186
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,234
Right? Right? Right?

187
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,028
I told you I didn't want
these antibiotics.

188
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,475
When your first grandkid
is born and you smell his head,

189
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,311
call me and tell me how great it is.

190
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,276
Mr Blair, I'm sorry this happened.

191
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:31,988
<i>Sometimes it hits you in places you</i>
<i>didn't know you were vulnerable.</i>

192
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,708
Yeah, well you should be,
it's your fault.

193
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,350
No more silly medical mistakes, huh?
Nice going there, Newbie.

194
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,907
<i>Damn.</i>

195
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,834
Ted, you seem different.

196
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,674
I bought some relaxation tapes.
They're working.

197
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,229
A patient's blaming me
for losing his sense of smell.

198
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,958
God, you cut off someone's nose?

199
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,270
Where is it? Do you have it on you?
You're disgusting.

200
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,156
No, I just gave him IV imipenem.

201
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,958
Kelso's gonna blame me.
Just get rid of the nose.

202
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,633
I don't have the nose.
Maybe you should calm down.

203
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:15,837
- Maybe you should calm down!
- My bad.

204
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,077
Imipenem.

205
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,909
"Unlike gentamicin and tetracycline,

206
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:29,548
imipenem has never been
associated with anosmia."

207
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,394
My God, we're OK.

208
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,232
Great. Thank you, Ted.

209
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,275
- It's my birthday.
- What?

210
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,428
Nothing.

211
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,113
<i>And many more...</i>

212
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,712
Elliot!

213
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,951
Come on. It's so tough to be a surgeon.
If you're not in, you're out.

214
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,588
Dr Turk. Down here.

215
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,067
I saw you switched off on our
exploratory laparotomy this afternoon.

216
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,195
Yeah, it's because I... I had to...

217
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,237
- It's because I'm short.
- You're not short.

218
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,117
I know I'm the surgical
assignment booby prize,

219
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,838
but if my other choice
is being in that boys' club,

220
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,511
I'd rather they made fun of me.

221
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,511
- What could they possibly make fun...
- Stop it.

222
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,433
It's possible to be a good surgeon
without playing their game.

223
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,750
- You're really short.
- I know.

224
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,956
No, Dr Murray, I don't want
any fries to go with this shake.

225
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,233
- I don't even know what that means.
- Excuse me.

226
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,152
You want to ask me how many
ceiling tiles I've counted?

227
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,311
Maybe you want to call me a name
like tramp, ho or slesident,

228
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,230
which is half slut, half resident.

229
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,116
- No.
- Then what is it, Noelle?

230
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,872
- I want to know where the G-spot is.
- The what spot?

231
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,598
For the 100th time,
you had nothing to do

232
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,308
with me getting involved in the Bumbry
case, but for God's sake,

233
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,196
the bigger problem facing us now

234
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,554
is how do we get you
to stop annoying me?

235
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,598
Yeah, I'm the problem. Can't you
just for once stay out of your own way?

236
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,955
Can't you for once
not be such a busybody?

237
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,075
Oh, sore spot.

238
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,434
- What spot?
- Sore spot.

239
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,713
Damn it!

240
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:10,711
<i>The next step is to find out what</i>
<i>did cause Mr Blair's loss of smell.</i>

241
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,233
- Hey, pal.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

242
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,152
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a janitor.

243
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,514
Oh. I just assumed because of the coat.

244
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:23,114
Right. Well, janitors wear
white coats around here too.

245
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,713
You guys do a great job
keeping this place clean.

246
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,949
- We thank you.
- No, I'm a doctor...

247
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,507
Look at the books, woman.

248
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,391
Is that a man's back?

249
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:37,755
Check out who I have assisting
Dr Rumpelsurgeon.

250
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,274
You know what?
His name's Dr Amato.

251
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,714
That girl you slept with,
her name's Dr Reid.

252
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,593
- You should show them some respect.
- Yeah? Says who?

253
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,471
Says me.

254
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,353
- Dr Kelso.
- Carla.

255
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,555
You look as good as I feel.

256
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,869
Mrs Bumbry's 53.

257
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,358
Mrs who is what?

258
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,033
The patient Dr Cox
got into the GI clinical trial.

259
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:13,078
She was disqualified because her chart
said she was 63 and the cut-off is 55,

260
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,832
but the genius who admitted her
got her age wrong.

261
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,353
She's actually a perfect candidate.

262
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,669
And Dr Cox knew this?

263
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,354
- He knew the whole time.
- Fan-damn-tastic.

264
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,109
You better do the heel-toe out of here

265
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,350
because you know I'm going
to take this out on somebody.

266
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,838
Bye-bye.

267
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,796
May I join you?

268
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,478
By all means.

269
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:43,833
<i>Knowing I was right and he was wrong,</i>
<i>I thought I'd enjoy this walk more.</i>

270
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,514
<i>I couldn't help but empathise</i>
<i>cos I'd been there and saw the signs.</i>

271
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,318
<i>The shameful averted gaze.</i>

272
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,310
<i>The nervous shifting.</i>

273
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,677
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>the wild, uncontrollable urination.</i>

274
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:08,914
I'm thrilled you approve, but, for the
last time, I'm up here. I'm up here.

275
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,273
- You were wrong. I was right.
- I beg your pardon?

276
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,919
Anosmia isn't a side-effect
of IV imipenem.

277
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,957
Plus, Mr Blair had nasal
polypectomies and septoplasty

278
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,315
and his loss of smell is caused
by manipulation of his sinuses

279
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,913
and the infection,
so I didn't make a mistake,

280
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,911
and you were wrong
when you said, "Nice going, Newbie."

281
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,194
Here you've put me in a tough situation.

282
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,352
I can't honestly decide
whether to say "duh" or "doy"

283
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,034
or a very sarcastic,
"Oh, really?" My God, Fiona.

284
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:41,077
I know it wasn't your fault.
The patient probably knows.

285
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,070
But he seemed a little distraught.

286
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,118
Maybe being able to blame somebody
for a second might make him feel better.

287
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,714
And, I know, maybe it's me,
but doesn't that seem like something

288
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,597
that goes along
with wearing that fancy white coat?

289
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,557
It does, doesn't it?

290
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,311
- Kinda.
- I'm so proud of you. Put it there.

291
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,309
The tarantula.

292
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,756
That girl asked me to give her
my top ten sexual positions,

293
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,751
and after the two that I knew,
I started naming insects.

294
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,716
That really sucks. I'm sorry.

295
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,154
I'm not sure. I mean,
I was mad at you at first.

296
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:24,552
But it's actually kind of empowering
to have this... persona, this identity.

297
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:28,393
I'm not just some nameless,
faceless white doctor,

298
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:31,312
I'm Elliot Reid, Tramp.

299
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,189
Well, that's great.
If you're happy, I'm happy.

300
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,113
The weird thing is she said
she'd already tried stink bug.

301
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:47,551
<i>I still don't know why I was desperate</i>
<i>for everyone to know it wasn't my fault.</i>

302
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:51,598
Dr Cox, Dr Kelso
has something he wants to say to you.

303
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,355
So I hear there was an age mix-up,
that I was unaware of,

304
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,158
and... anyway...

305
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:03,236
- You're OK.
- I'm sorry.

306
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,470
<i>I guess it comes down to how</i>
<i>we want to be seen by other people.</i>

307
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,317
I proud of you, Robert.
Put her there.

308
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,912
I think it's important you understand
I had no idea how old that patient was.

309
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:21,117
For the record, she could've been 170,
I still would've stuck her in that trial

310
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,952
so fast it'd make your teeth
fall out all over again.

311
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,234
- That's perfect.
- I would too.

312
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,708
<i>Some people want to be seen</i>
<i>as the rebel.</i>

313
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,237
<i>Some people just want</i>
<i>to be seen, period.</i>

314
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,114
<i>Some people have limits on how far</i>
<i>they'll go to protect their image.</i>

315
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,555
- Dr Turk, I need you down here.
- Coming.

316
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:50,474
<i>When I stopped worrying how other</i>
<i>people saw me I started to look better.</i>

317
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,508
Mr Blair, I just wanted to say again
that I made a mistake and I'm sorry.

318
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,909
- It's all right.
- Good luck.

319
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,514
Come on, baby.
Let's see if we can find you a ride.

320
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,590
Laverne!

321
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,994
Careful.

322
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,867
So we're done with the coats?
It was a fun day, though, wasn't it?

323
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,312
See you tomorrow.
