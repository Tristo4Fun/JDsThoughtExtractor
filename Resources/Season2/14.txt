1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,955
<i>It's not every day your best bud</i>
<i>asks his girlfriend to marry him.</i>

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,190
Hey, Chocolate Bear, did you ask her?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,876
She said she needed to think about it,
then she went to Chicago for five days.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,155
<i>He needs you. Stay positive.</i>

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,752
She's thinking, she's thinking,
and we should go out drinking...

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,550
- Wanna get a beer?
- I am not moving until she calls.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,154
All right, man. I understand.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,199
Still nothing?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,272
We just keep missing each other.
I'm not sweating it.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,510
She asked me to pick her up
from the airport. That's a good sign.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
Good sign? I am so sure
Carla's going to say yes.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,791
If she doesn't, I'll walk naked through
these halls singing <i>Me And Bobby McGee.</i>

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,236
Janis Joplin. Good God, she was an uggo.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,036
No offence, don't think I have
anything against ugly people.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,954
- Why would I take offence?
- No reason.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,272
I see you're on the nephrology service
with Doctor Townshend this month.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,319
<i>Doctor Townshend is like the anti-Kelso.</i>
<i>The nurses love him.</i>

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,277
Patty, that colour is great on you.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,793
<i>The attendings love him.</i>

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,077
- How's the best doctor here?
- You tell me, hotshot.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,151
<i>Everyone loves him.</i>

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,993
<i>Everyone.</i>

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,799
Thank you... for being you.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,117
<i>The weirdest thing of all</i>
<i>is he and Kelso are best friends.</i>

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,033
- There he is!
- Missed you on our morning jog, buddy.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,270
What is that now,
about 200 days in a row?

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,749
You're a pistol!

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,676
The only place this guy's running to is
to a bakery. Who's got me up high?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,912
The mistake you made there,
you didn't pat his belly.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,592
- It soothes him.
- Dammit.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,670
It's so beautiful.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,675
I would have showed it to you before
you left but I couldn't get to it.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,671
That is a long story.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,671
Thank you for not pressuring me.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,958
Don't get me wrong, you left me 40
messages in five days, but I know you.

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,429
If you weren't holding back,
it would be 140.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,750
I do love the speed dial.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,312
So, you got an answer yet?

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,230
What's the deal, there, Gandhi?
Are you gonna be a bride?

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,676
Oh, come on,
this is one of those very small windows

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,433
when I'm borderline interested
in your life.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,034
What's the deal?
She give you an answer?

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,398
<i>Freedom's just another word</i>
<i>for nothing left to lose</i>

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,198
Not yet.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,755
Here's the 50 bucks I promised.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,070
Keep it, man. That was for me.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,950
- Todd, get dressed.
- I'm going back out there.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,910
I can't believe I walked naked through
the halls of the hospital last night.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,151
- I know that wasn't you.
- How?

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,232
I could pick your Puffn'Stuff
out of a lineup.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,232
It changed since you saw it.
It got a haircut.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,949
<i>Turk's brother is staying</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,715
- Little brother.
- How's it going?

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,836
- <i>It'll be fun.</i>
- Hey, Kev.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,195
Hey, Alfalfa! What's the happy-haps?

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,556
That depends. What's a happy-hap?

57
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,359
So, this is the place, huh?
This is nice.

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,591
Hey, hey, so, how's this baby,
is it all right?

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,752
- This here is fit for a king.
- Well, that's good.

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,389
Makes me feel better about sleeping
in your room while you're here.

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,038
That's not gonna work.

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,076
I'm a businessman, we can work it out.

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,517
I sent you to college and med school,
and you have done nothing for me.

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,672
I'll sleep on the couch
and you cut me a cheque for 80 grand.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,070
- I'll go get my pillow.
- That was good, Kev.

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,879
We should make him
make dinner for us tonight.

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,758
- He'd be our personal slave.
- Our personal what?

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,877
Oh, no, I don't mean
like that kind of slave.

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,635
How 'bout he be the house slave,
and I be the field slave?

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,757
- Does that sound fun to you?
- No, that wouldn't be fun.

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,512
What's going on?

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,751
I forgot how much fun it was
messing with Alfalfa.

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,632
The reason we're late
is you took forever to get ready.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,756
That's what happens when you're vain.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,276
Whatever, Mr Yesterday-l-Had-Chest-Hair
-Today-l-Don't.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,555
<i>Sometimes Elliot can't help herself.</i>

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,234
- Dr Cox, you're a waxer?
- Hark!

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,472
It is the high-pitched warble
of the Nosey Nellie.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,597
Don't see many of those flitting
about the halls anymore.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,036
Quite frankly when one does,
one shoots to kill.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,669
Now, Barbie, Jordan is here
for her ultrasound today,

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,479
and I'm going to be holding
her claw the entire time,

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,199
so what you've done
is essentially volunteered

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,794
to do all of your work and all of mine.

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,510
Step this way, I'll be more than glad to
tell you more about what you've won.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,239
- See you at lunch, Bobby.
- Split-pea soup today.

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,436
Sir, Dr Townshend was telling me

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,114
you have some great
stories about the hospital.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,749
- I'd love to hear one sometime.
- Well, what the hell.

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,469
Back in '68... I don't like you.
The end.

91
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,711
- He tells that one a lot.
- I know.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,275
I know you're labouring over this
proposal so I'll sweeten the pot

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,874
by telling you
I have a killer best man's toast.

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,235
I'm going to rush
my biggest decision

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,914
so I can hear you say,
"When I first met Chris Turk,

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,151
I knew this was a guy
I could party with forever. Yeah!"

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,310
Please.
<i>She's psychic.</i>

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,392
I want a nice lunch
with my boyfriend and his brother.

99
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,870
<i>Carla didn't know Turk was using</i>
<i>his brother as a selling point.</i>

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,474
<i>Because no one said family</i>
<i>more than Kevin Turk.</i>

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,198
- Baby...
- Yeah?

102
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,592
- Check out my brother's kids.
- Oh, they're adorable.

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,796
How's that great marriage of yours?

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,950
- Over.
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

105
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,110
- Say what?
- I couldn't take it any more.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,476
- I had to get the hell out of there.
- Get the hell out of there?

107
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,279
<i>Do something to change the subject.</i>
<i>Anything.</i>

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,635
Everybody, soda-chugging contest!

109
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,914
- Excuse me.
- When did you have the fajitas?

110
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
So, are we finding out
the sex of the baby today?

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,272
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,557
If you're incubating
some kind of man-bat in there,

113
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,633
we should find out as soon as possible.
There are vaccinations to consider.

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,795
Tell you what, we'll compromise. I'll
decide this, and you get to decide...

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,475
- Sorry, I've got nothing.
- It's common to feel differently.

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,030
Actually, I'm not the father,
he's a bellboy in Greece.

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,634
- We think.
- Neat.

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,076
- It's kicking me.
- Who can blame the poor thing?

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,077
<i>That's odd.</i>

120
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,837
- What the hell just happened?
- I moved your ladder.

121
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,514
I don't know why you keep
doing these things to me.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,158
I don't know either.

123
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,993
Well, if it isn't my favourite
custodial engineer.

124
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,911
- Do me a favour, will you?
- Yeah.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,595
Help me look after this kid.
One of the good guys.

126
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,432
I've got a meeting this afternoon,
but what do you say

127
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,829
tonight me and you tear it up
like we used to?

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,319
I've got to work.

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,109
Get somebody to cover your ass.
I'm only here for the weekend.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,352
I just asked Carla to marry me and
you were in there acting like a jerk.

131
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,877
Man, you're engaged? Congratulations.

132
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,837
She hasn't exactly said yes yet.

133
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,912
Sometimes a lady
just needs to sleep on it.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,594
- I asked her a week ago.
- Damn.

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,275
On the bright side,
you are definitely flying solo tonight.

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm out.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,117
Hey, Chris, come on, now,
I was just playing.

138
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,156
Chris!

139
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,159
If you really don't want to know
the sex, it's time to look away.

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,869
Dr Cox, I...
Excuse me, I just need you.

141
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,390
This is ridiculous. I'm going to
find out the sex of the baby.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,835
Dr Gerson's not gonna tell you.

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,148
Look.

144
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,038
Oh, gosh, I guess I'm stuck, then.

145
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,078
All righty.

146
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,071
We'll talk later.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,673
Go.

148
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,910
Out. Chop-chop.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,673
- Sir, can I call you Townsie?
- No.

150
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,513
<i>I was having a great time</i>
<i>working with Townsie.</i>

151
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,715
Now, Mr Singer here needs a swan,

152
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,234
so why don't you go ahead
and do an IJ cut-down?

153
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,788
<i>A cut-down? No one does those anymore.</i>

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,917
Shouldn't I do a modified Seldinger?
It's much safer.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,468
Nah. Come on, let's do old-school.

156
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,313
- But, sir, I don't...
- Scalpel. I'll get the kit.

157
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,959
Somebody...

158
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,828
<i>So often in a hospital,</i>
<i>you feel you're alone on an island.</i>

159
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,995
<i>Whether it's because you can't bring</i>
<i>yourself to make an important decision.</i>

160
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,750
<i>Or because you're waiting for an answer.</i>

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,356
<i>Or because you know a secret</i>
<i>you wish you didn't.</i>

162
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,192
<i>I was on that island</i>
<i>because somebody else put me there.</i>

163
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,273
OK, c'mon now, just cut through.
Good.

164
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,876
Open up the vein. But be careful
not to nick the carotid artery.

165
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,835
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,596
The vascular surgeon said
pick up your patient this evening.

167
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,114
He also said he could
give you a loaner patient

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,670
if you needed someone to butcher
until then, but I didn't get it.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,957
- No one expects you to, son.
- OK, thanks.

170
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,511
<i>This sucks, but as bad as I feel,</i>

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,876
<i>Dr Townshend feels even worse</i>
<i>for making me do the procedure.</i>

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
Don't worry about it.
I'll take the blame.

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,153
<i>He hides it well.</i>

174
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,754
Do you really think
he wants to get married?

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,308
Any guy willing to scour
the face of the earth

176
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,709
to find the world's
smallest diamond ring

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,030
clearly knows
exactly what he wants.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,076
I don't know if he's mature enough.

179
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,391
He couldn't stop giggling
when he had to operate on Mr Wiener.

180
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,833
- It's a funny name.
- Stop it.

181
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,230
Look, the guy is 27 years old,
he's a surgeon,

182
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,118
involved in a long-term,
monogamous relationship.

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,113
As much as I'd love to trash him,
I'm not down with the maturity thing.

184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,069
Barbie! I need you to go to the lab
and get Mrs Miller's bloodwork.

185
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,594
I also need you
to disimpact Mr Burnett in 317

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,194
and what did you say
the sex of the child was?

187
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,113
You do those things,
and when you're done,

188
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,270
I'll think about telling you the sex.

189
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,955
Seems you went to a swap meet
and got yourself a big-boy spine.

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,076
- You tell or else.
- Or else what?

191
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,879
You'll treat me worse
than you usually do?

192
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,193
Here's the inside scoop. I have
leverage. You're familiar with leverage?

193
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,669
You'll need it
when you disimpact Mr Burnett,

194
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,673
who is so locked up he's
been eating gum, rubber cement or cork.

195
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,672
- Look, Barbie...
- Yeah, that's not my name.

196
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,637
Fine. Doctor...

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,676
Reid? Really?

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,832
- What?
- Nothing.

199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,115
Elliot Reid in the house!

200
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,873
Sit.

201
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,158
- Oh, no, thanks, I'll just...
- I'm not asking.

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,231
This is the kid I told you about.

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,392
We're gonna look out for him.
This is Brent, from Parking.

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,598
He'll set you up with a sweet spot at
the entrance so you're never late again.

205
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,989
Crazy Eyes Margo,
from Housekeeping.

206
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,392
She'll make sure you got freshly pressed
scrubs in your locker every morning.

207
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,278
This is Troy.
You know him from the cafeteria line.

208
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,635
He's gonna stop spitting in your food.

209
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,597
Thank you for that.

210
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,752
I don't understand
why we gotta be nice to this punk.

211
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,193
- I said so.
- Yeah, but...

212
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,919
Troy. No more warnings.

213
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,910
Bring the hands in.

214
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,870
Bless us and thy gifts we are about to
receive from thy bounty through Christ.

215
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,713
Look out for each of us,
including our new member.

216
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,314
Help Margo
to find her way home tonight.

217
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,073
<i>Still, something was bothering me.</i>

218
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,754
How many more times
will you make me apologise

219
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,876
for introducing you to your wife?

220
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,714
- Once a month until she's dead.
- Sir, do you have a second?

221
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,509
Sport, what did I tell you
about my open-door policy?

222
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,397
- I don't have one.
- Dr Kelso.

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,994
I was the one who nicked the artery
on Mr Singer.

224
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,753
Cheese on rye, son,
I just said it was me.

225
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,391
Shape up, son. Lord knows you're never
gonna get by on your looks.

226
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,678
Right, first of all, at the very least,
I'm interesting-looking, all right?

227
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,991
And secondly, I feel I made that mistake

228
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,072
because Dr Townshend forced me
to perform a procedure

229
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,754
that is unsafe and outdated.

230
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,517
<i>Sorry, Townsie.</i>

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,436
Let me get this straight.

232
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,671
You screwed up doing something
you should be able to handle

233
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,673
and now you're here to tattle on the guy
who's taking the bullet for you?

234
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,751
Is that right?

235
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,313
Do me a favour, will you, son?
Grab that for me.

236
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,358
Thanks.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,116
I'm sorry, sir.

238
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,357
- Kelly clamp.
- Kelly clamp coming right up.

239
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,953
Hey, Rowdy.

240
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,354
- You seem distracted. Something wrong?
- No, sir. I call everyone Rowdy.

241
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,710
Want me to leave him in the car?

242
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,076
You freaked out my girlfriend.
You want to get me fired?

243
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,073
- Why not smack me in my face?
- Fine. Check this out.

244
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,835
I can't believe this attitude.
I've taken care of you your entire life

245
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,595
and I tell you that I'm getting
divorced, and you make it about you.

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,395
You didn't seem too broken up about it.
Why should I care?

247
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,238
She left me, OK?

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,030
All righty there, Dr Leverage, listen up
because here's the real inside scoop.

249
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,793
I could literally sculpt
a gigantic Mr Burnett

250
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,519
out of what I just removed
from Mr Burnett,

251
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,751
so I think it's in your interest
for you to start talking.

252
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,957
Should I get the child
a baseball glove or a tutu?

253
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,999
- Girls can play baseball, too.
- I know what girls can do.

254
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,389
You've come a long way, baby.
Spill, doll.

255
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,755
I really think
you should think about this,

256
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,354
so I wrote it down
and I put it in an envelope

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,795
and then I gave it to her.

258
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,917
Hi, honey.

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,719
Oh, you are just
so going to pay for this.

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,553
Yeah, well, so are you.

261
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,278
Bend over, baby.

262
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,675
I think Mr Singer's gonna be just fine.

263
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,718
Oh, jeez, Bob,
don't creep up on me like that.

264
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,792
I almost dropped some fruit in my looms.

265
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,359
I'm sorry, buddy.

266
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,353
Say, listen, nowadays,
it has become kind of hospital protocol

267
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,874
to do a modified Seldinger
in a case like this.

268
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,793
You do know how to do one of those,
don't you?

269
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,313
- Of course.
- Good.

270
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,233
Because the patient
in bed number two needs one.

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,880
You mind doing it for me?

272
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,837
What the hell's this all about?

273
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,959
Nothing,
I was just looking over your files

274
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,190
and well...

275
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,670
...your oesteoporotic patients
aren't on bisphosphonates,

276
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,638
your diabetics aren't
on ACE inhibitors.

277
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,474
Doug, a lot of your treatments
are pretty out of date.

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,553
C'mon, Bob, guys like us,
we're set in our ways.

279
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,835
This is not an age thing, Doug.

280
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,593
These days, if you're out of med school
five years,

281
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,148
half of what you learned is obsolete.

282
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,674
Why do I spend every
other weekend at a seminar

283
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,231
in some two-star hotel ballroom that
still stinks of last night's prom vomit?

284
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,118
I do it because I have to keep up.

285
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,317
Also, it gives you two days
away from the missus, right?

286
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,359
Once again, sorry I was the one
who introduced you in the first place.

287
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,394
Look, Bob, I just...

288
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,392
I don't have the energy
for all that stuff.

289
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,675
Well...

290
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,751
Then we got a problem.

291
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,389
So, you want to talk
about what happened?

292
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,755
No, man, look, it's just too depressing.

293
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,197
You're in a bad place, but you'll
get through it. Give it time.

294
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,475
What am I supposed to do until then?

295
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,599
Barkeep, I'm going to need these two
glasses and that bottle of whiskey.

296
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,150
Excuse me, my brother definitely
needs to borrow your hat.

297
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,515
And for the love of all that is holy,

298
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,592
would somebody
please put on some country?

299
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,469
- We are a horrible couple.
- You couldn't be more wrong.

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,634
Even though that isn't my kid in there,
I still want to feel connected

301
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,473
and I just thought
I'd be more hooked in if I knew.

302
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,152
It's funny.

303
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,597
Every time I think you're the same old,
sharp-edged jackass,

304
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,071
you turn around and do something
to remind me that you're such a pansy!

305
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,119
Listen. I was hoping the two of us
could find out when the baby comes.

306
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,398
But if you really need to know now,
just keep it to yourself.

307
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,831
Run away there, missy, cos guilt trips
don't work on old Perrerino.

308
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,833
If you're still standing there
when I turn around,

309
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,798
I'm gonna have them
erase your name, too.

310
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,711
Goodnight, sir.

311
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,268
<i>It's not always easy</i>
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

312
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,399
This is to my brother, y'all,
my brother!

313
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,837
<i>Like putting someone else's feelings</i>
<i>first for a change.</i>

314
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,832
<i>Even if it goes against</i>
<i>what you really want.</i>

315
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,313
No.

316
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,073
<i>Of course, there's always ramifications.</i>

317
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,230
<i>My car.</i>

318
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,915
You think it's my fault he got fired?

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,958
- Why would you say that?
- No reason.

320
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,511
Let's see you drive home now,
Mr Doctor Man.

321
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,831
Troy! I said just stand there, didn't I?

322
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,389
Yeah.

323
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,990
I may have to get rid of the guy.

324
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,237
<i>Even if you do the right thing, there's</i>
<i>no guarantee it'll turn out right.</i>

325
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,077
