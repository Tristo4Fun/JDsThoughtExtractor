1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,516
<i>Since she lost her apartment,</i>
<i>I let Elliot crash on my floor.</i>

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,909
How did this happen?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,676
JD, I'm homeless. I have no money and
everything I own is outside in a truck.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,437
My life's a mess. Plus, you were
going through a lot, too.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,990
My peep was on the fritz.
Much better now, thank you for asking.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,594
We were vulnerable
and we made a mistake.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,116
Four times. And a half,
if you count that last thing.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,352
By the way, that third time, wow!
Where did you learn that?

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,034
- What are you watching, buddy?
- <i>Animal Planet.</i>

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192
Why does that monkey keep
biting the other one on the ass?

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,078
I don't know,
but she seems to love it.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,873
The Congo. But, look, Elliot,
I think... I think you're right.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,952
Last night was great,
but we can't keep doing this.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,952
- Dr Reid.
- Dr Dorian.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,752
<i>Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex</i>
<i>is it always puts you in a good mood.</i>

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,674
<i>Hell, I think it even cheers up</i>
<i>the people around you.</i>

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,515
Oh, joy. I get to work on Mrs Creeden
with the Wonder Twins.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,798
Dear Lord, what in Thy most holy name
have I done to offend Thee so?

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,713
My brother and I would pretend
we were the Wonder Twins.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,588
He would become "form of a dragon"
and I had to be something made of water,

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,591
so I'd say "shape of an ice dragon."

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,434
He would say I was copying him and
he'd breathe on me and I'd have to melt,

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,511
but it was still so awesome.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,869
That's funny, I don't recall asking for
a really, really, really, really,

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,235
really boring story.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,198
My God, Barbie,
don't you understand no one cares?

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
- I care.
- Correction. No one important cares.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,790
Mrs Creeden is in post-op, so let's
start by CAT-scanning her abdomen.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,954
And gosh, all kidding aside, I'd like to
see us work together on this one.

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,196
Come on, now.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,631
Hands in.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,513
Please.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,629
Congratulations again.
He is beautiful.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,274
I was wondering about circumcision.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,599
You're a little old, but my roommate
is a surgeon, he owes me a favour...

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,910
Talking about their son, Bambi.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,115
Well, now, see,
that we're set up for.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,033
We wanted to know
how you felt about it, Carla.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,109
Me?

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,512
<i>Carla loves her patients. But she also</i>
<i>loves how much they love her.</i>

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,431
To be honest, I'm not a big fan.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,751
I've always wonder what the kid
would say if it were up to him.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,753
You want to do what, now?
I just got this thing.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,033
There are no medical advantages
to circumcision.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,918
- I told you.
- Not medical, personal.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,389
<i>That's just great.</i>

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,957
What a day.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,949
I am as stressed out
and vulnerable as I was last night.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,712
- Me too.
- What to do?

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,510
- What to do? What to do?
- I don't feel like doing anything.

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,709
Come on, we could rent a movie.
Got a fresh pack of Uno cards.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,918
You know what we could do?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,798
We could have sex again.
I'm throwing it out there.

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,678
- Bite me.
- Oh, come on, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,751
I was kidding. It's a joke.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,876
No, I mean it. Like you did last night.
Come bite me.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,951
<i>Stay calm.</i>

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,956
I'm so relaxed.
I totally forgot about being a doctor.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,439
You're a doctor?

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,273
The problem is we know
that we don't work as a couple.

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,750
- We're a train wreck.
- So we can't keep doing this.

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,950
- Hello and whoa.
- JD, it's just sex.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,114
We're adults. I don't think we have to
apologise for enjoying what we're doing.

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,636
<i>That's when she said the words</i>
<i>every man is dying to hear.</i>

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,472
We could just be sex buddies.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,031
If you want.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,119
My wife won't listen to reason.

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,877
Mr Marrick, even if your son isn't
circumcised, he'll still look like you.

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,191
Of course, he'll have to put on
a couple of hundred pounds.

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,477
I kid. You're a dashing man.
Have you modelled?

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,473
- What's all that about?
- I can't tell you.

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,791
It's, you know,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,758
Oh, right. Tell me.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,752
No, no, I'm not kidding. I can't.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,308
Can't. Or won't.

76
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,676
- Can't.
- Won't!

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,956
- Are they still going at it?
- No, Kelso calmed them down.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,713
- I think we're OK.
- We're not OK.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,598
What're you talking about?

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,310
You were gonna get that CAT scan
on Mrs Creeden's abdomen.

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,597
I have been crazy busy
on the phone with bill collectors,

82
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,148
who, by the way,
are obsessed with money.

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,879
I spent an hour in my truck
looking for clean bras.

84
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,315
All I've got
is this date-night push-up one.

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,392
I don't like working with these
under my chin all day.

86
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,516
I am walking
someplace right now,

87
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,353
and for the life of me
I can't remember where.

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,513
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks. Bathroom!

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,799
Does this name-tag say
"Chief of Medicine"?

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,472
- Yes, sir.
- Funny.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,270
That couple thought it said "I'm Bob.
Ask me about your baby's Johnson."

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,275
Dammit, In my hospital we do not
go out on a limb with our opinions.

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,797
So if a patient has questions
in your hospital, you just ignore them?

94
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,796
Look, stay away from definite answers.
Leave yourself some wiggle room.

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,555
Say things like "We'll do what we can"
or "We'll get back to you on that"

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,837
- Or "Hell, I don't know."
- Couldn't think of a third one?

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,718
That was the third one.

98
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,596
Assface.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,956
Hey, chum. What do you say?

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,795
I wanted to tell you not to worry about
getting that CAT scan on Mrs Creeden.

101
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,158
I'll just rip her stitches open, jam
my head in and have a look for myself.

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,550
When I tell you to do something,
you better get it done!

103
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,952
<i>It sucks being yelled at, especially</i>
<i>when it's someone else's fault.</i>

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,110
That was big of you to cover for Elliot.

105
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,430
I had a good mind
to spank her yesterday.

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,636
She screw up
with your patients, too?

107
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,188
- No.
- Elliot seems so frazzled.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,714
She keeps making
one mistake after another.

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,519
I mean, I wish I could help her out.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,160
I have no idea how that woman
handles the stress.

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,717
I feel so much better.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,916
- See ya, bud.
- Later, dude.

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,672
Mr Woodbury's son is getting married.
He's asking if he's gonna be able to go.

114
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,116
He's got a nasty case of pneumonia.
Let's see.

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,670
His leukocytosis has resolved.
His blood cultures are negative.

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,512
Tell him we'll do the best we can.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,750
Can't we just tell him
that he can go?

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,638
Where's the wiggle room in that?
There's no wiggle.

119
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,635
Fine, let me just tell him with you
so I can enjoy it too.

120
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,757
- Thank so you much.
- Oh, you're so very welcome.

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,956
- It's my pleasure.
- This is great.

122
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,554
<i>OK, just give her a casual nod.</i>

123
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,359
<i>You don't want Turk</i>
<i>to know what's going on.</i>

124
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,749
- You're hitting that.
- How do you do that?

125
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,638
It's a gift. Remember last time
you two got together?

126
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,517
Relax. We're just having fun.

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,795
What, are you guys just sex buddies?

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,878
Fa-shizzle.

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,712
I don't wanna
get Dr Phil on you,

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,349
but women have a hard time
separating sex from emotions.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,908
You may think you're
tapping that right now,

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,470
but pretty soon she's gonna be
like, "JD, I need you."

133
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,790
If it got that emotional,
I'd break it off.

134
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,235
OK. Oh, by the way,
dude right there

135
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,756
is totally hitting that dude,
he's totally hitting him.

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,957
- You are good.
- I know.

137
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,316
I'm so glad
Esteban found someone.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,157
What's up, Laverne?

139
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,199
This Friday my church group's doing
a production of <i>Rent</i> if you wanna go.

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,158
"What's up" that doesn't
make me want to shoot myself?

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,435
How's Mr Lawrence doing?

142
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,795
That's no longer any of your business.

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,031
He's not your patient
as of two o'clock this afternoon.

144
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,838
He asked for a new doctor.

145
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,071
The second to switch off of
my service today. Why?

146
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,516
They were so overwhelmed
by the high quality of your care

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,909
they couldn't stand it another second?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,309
I won't let you
make me feel like crap today.

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,154
Every doctor has had patients switch off
of them for no reason at all,

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,276
and it is just some
dumb coinkydink

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,476
it happened to me
twice on the same day.

152
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,792
If you will excuse me, I have to
check on Mrs Finnegan's chest X-rays.

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,270
No, you don't.
She switched off too.

154
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,114
<i>Around here things</i>
<i>can turn bad in a heartbeat.</i>

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
Mr Woodbury
is still requiring a lot of O2.

156
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,436
We have to keep him here over the
weekend. Give him the skinny, will you?

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,715
<i>I guess when you work</i>
<i>in a world of uncertainty,</i>

158
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,678
<i>it's great to have something</i>
<i>at home you can count on.</i>

159
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,918
Elliot, what are you doing?

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,437
Just sitting in the dark, crying,
so, you know, the usual.

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,957
JD, I had such a crappy day. I really
need you right now. Come here.

162
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,077
<i>She "needs"you?</i>
<i>Oh, my God, Turk was right.</i>

163
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,517
<i>Stop kissing her and put an end to this</i>
<i>before she gets hurt.</i>

164
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,431
Is there something wrong?

165
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,875
<i>Ah, she's a tough kid.</i>
<i>You can tell her later.</i>

166
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,871
Nope.

167
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,115
<i>What did you do?</i>
<i>All right, don't panic.</i>

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,318
<i>Maybe she didn't enjoy it.</i>
<i>Oh, come on, who're you kidding?</i>

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,836
I don't get it. Why are so many
patients switching off on me?

170
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,036
Are my hands that cold?

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,759
- You didn't tell anyone I'm Republican?
- No.

172
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,310
This can't be happening.
I'm a doctor.

173
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,790
What use is being a doctor
if nobody lets you treat them?

174
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,758
What is going on with my life?

175
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,431
<i>This is not the time to talk it out.</i>

176
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,389
<i>Get out of the situation</i>
<i>without making her suspicious.</i>

177
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,993
Hello?

178
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,957
Hi, Mom.

179
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,273
Yeah, I miss you too.
I haven't spoken to you in so long.

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,590
Hi, Mr Turk.
No, Chris isn't here.

181
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,671
No, no, sir. I didn't say "Mom."

182
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,719
I said, "mon" like,
"Hey, mon, we be jamming."

183
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,915
No, sir, I don't think
all black people are Jamaican.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,150
I love you too, Mommy.

185
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,198
Sir, could you call back later?
Chris will be home.

186
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,228
There's been some break-ins. I had to
change the locks on these lockers.

187
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
You should've gotten
your new combination.

188
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,679
Well, I didn't.
Do you know what it is?

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,911
- Yeah.
- But you're not gonna tell me.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,310
Can't. Janitor-locker confidentiality.

191
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,551
<i>He made that up.</i>

192
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,671
Are you watching <i>Sesame Street?</i>

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,470
When I was a kid, I had
my first sex dream about Mr Hooper.

194
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,199
At least, I think it was a sex dream.

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,750
- He was trying to choke me.
- Yeah, that's sweet.

196
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,116
- Are you on a break?
- I have nothing else to do.

197
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,031
None of my patients wanna see me.

198
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,477
That's a good thing. Now you have time
to take care of your life.

199
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,710
Why are you being so weird?

200
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,759
Well, of course, that could be because
he's shaving his dome so much lately

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,550
that the hair's starting to grow inward.
It's an affliction known as the "infro."

202
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,676
But if I were to guess
just exactly why

203
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,912
he's been acting weird lately,
I would say it's because...

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,879
he's the one who's been steering
your patients away from you.

205
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Discuss.

206
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,398
<i>Carla has to give</i>
<i>Mr Woodbury the bad news.</i>

207
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,675
- How bad could it be?
- Here she is.

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,159
<i>I wonder how he'll take it.</i>

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,193
Take her! Out the window!
Throw her out the window!

210
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,314
Here goes.

211
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,995
Mr Woodbury's doing
well enough to be discharged.

212
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,594
I don't mind standing up
to Kelso on this one.

213
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,356
Time to take the "GR" off my "gratitude"
and give him some attitude, JD style.

214
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,796
- His office is that way.
- I have to throw up first.

215
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,791
- What the hell, Turk?
- Good, Barbie.

216
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,589
- Now really access the anger.
- How could you do that to me?

217
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,398
Yeah, honestly, how could you?

218
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,755
I wanted to protect you,
give you a break.

219
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,435
The old "I'm trying to help you" gambit.
Barbie, see through that.

220
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,670
Yo kick him right now.

221
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,588
Elliot, I am sorry!

222
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,876
<i>Now's your chance. You're at work.</i>
<i>She won't get emotional.</i>

223
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,590
<i>Walk in and tell her things are getting</i>
<i>too serious. Just butter her up first.</i>

224
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,559
Look at you, Miss "No one wants me
to be their doctor again."

225
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,518
I don't see
Mr Ellis here complaining.

226
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,592
- He's in a coma.
- Elliot, we should talk.

227
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,956
Turk was telling my patients
to switch off of my service.

228
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,837
What?

229
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,110
Yeah, he said
he was trying to protect me.

230
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,714
I'll go talk to him.

231
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,954
That IV looks like it's infiltrating.
The nurse must have screwed up.

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,070
I did that.

233
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,958
What's with the mouthful of Chicklets,
sweetheart?

234
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,758
- No special reason.
- Really?

235
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,559
I thought it might be because
Dr Dorian came to see me

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,359
with his feathers all up,
and his voice a-crackin',

237
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,829
and told me he was letting
Mr Woodbury go.

238
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,558
- Oh, did he?
- Yup.

239
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,791
His knees were knocking
so loud I almost didn't see you

240
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,836
above him pulling the strings.

241
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,390
- Look, Dr Kelso...
- Maybe Mr Woodbury will be fine.

242
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,278
Maybe he'll be back
in a few days even worse for wear

243
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,238
because you rushed him out.
Who knows?

244
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,915
But darn it all if what I don't
think is the bigger question

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,275
is why you even give a hoot.

246
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,797
Well, actually, sir, I have this little
problem with caring for my patients.

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,589
Still, if you decide later
that what you really care about

248
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,875
is how much your patients like you,

249
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,555
you can change your mind
about letting Mr Woodbury leave.

250
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,200
Hell, I'll even back you up.

251
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,317
- Apologise.
- Apologise to you?

252
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,516
To Richard.
That was his basketball.

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,232
Hello, Richard. Tomorrow at lunch
I'll bring you a new basketball.

254
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,673
And a hoagie.

255
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,357
This is about Elliot?

256
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,319
Don't you wanna hear my side
of the story with your sex buddy?

257
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,716
- No.
- Come on, where's the love?

258
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,951
Where's the loyalty?
Where's the automatically

259
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,594
siding with the person
you care about the most?

260
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,115
Oh, my God. That's what
you're doing, isn't it? Isn't it?

261
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,592
<i>Some realisations</i>
<i>stop you in your tracks.</i>

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,713
<i>Others can lead you</i>
<i>in new directions.</i>

263
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,268
Dr Cox. I just wanted
to let you know that Turk

264
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,477
did the right thing by taking
my patients off of my service.

265
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,155
No. What that yellow-bellied
scalpel jock should have done

266
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,677
was go to surgery and schedule himself
for an early-morning add-a-pair-domy.

267
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,115
That way, if it took,
he'd have the stones

268
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,873
to come and talk to you
next time he had a problem.

269
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,238
I can't seem to stop letting my
life out there affect my life in here.

270
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,598
Well, hell, Barbie, look at me.
It's not like I've always been

271
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,196
the well-adjusted Guy Smiley you see
walking down the halls of this dump.

272
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,829
Stuff like that takes time,
but eventually you learn

273
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,675
to keep your personal problems
separate from this place.

274
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,673
- So, what do I do until then?
- Get your damn life in order.

275
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,189
And, Barbie, let's say word got out that
Uncle Cox was doling out the feel-goods,

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,509
I'll make you pay.
You have no idea.

277
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,431
Huge.

278
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,832
<i>It's a funny thing when we're</i>
<i>forced to see ourselves in a new light.</i>

279
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,478
Mr Woodbury! Hold on a sec.

280
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,358
<i>Hopefully, you see yourself</i>
<i>in time to make a change.</i>

281
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,638
We're not comfortable discharging you
just yet. I'm really, really sorry.

282
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,790
<i>Hopefully</i>
<i>you'll be respected for it.</i>

283
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,348
You evil little witch.

284
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,591
Let me see that chart, Nurse.

285
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,315
Well, I see no reason we should
keep Mr Woodbury any longer.

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,119
Enjoy your son's wedding.
Cherish the moments.

287
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,031
Thank you so much, Dr...?

288
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,429
Kelso. Bob Kelso.

289
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,557
- Bye, Bob!
- Glad I could help.

290
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,429
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>the new light opens your eyes</i>

291
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,798
<i>to something you've known</i>
<i>in your heart all along.</i>

292
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,917
It just feels like every day
keeps getting worse.

293
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,711
- What's all this?
- I just felt like taking care of you.

294
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,711
This is so nice.

295
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,951
<i>It's nice because</i>
<i>it's the beginning of something.</i>

296
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,556
- I can't do this.
- OK, less tongue.

297
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,918
No, this.
You know, sex buddies.

298
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,154
Dr Cox and I were talking and my life is
just so scattered right now. I just...

299
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,629
I just can't seem to grab
a toehold, you know?

300
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,712
And I know myself,
and if we keep doing this,

301
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,678
I'm won't be able to separate
the sex from my feelings,

302
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,876
and we'll end up
being a couple again.

303
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,952
And neither one of us
wants that, right?

304
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,879
I mean, I know I don't.

305
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,996
Me neither.

306
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,913
So, what do we do?

307
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,113
It's no big deal. You get your stuff out
of my room and you crash on the couch.

308
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,431
Thanks.
