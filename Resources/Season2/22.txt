1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,633
Nurse Espinoza,

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,474
do you by any chance know
what time your 9.30 shift starts?

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,757
- 9:30?
- That's what I would've said.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,035
But I had Ted stand out
in the parking lot

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,590
and monitor your arrival
times this week. Ted?

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,198
9.34, 9.39, 9.41, 9.33 and 9.50.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,999
How is that law degree
working out for you, Ted?

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,355
I was going to be a senator.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
I haven't perused
the latest nursing contract,

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,436
I'm guessing it doesn't say "show up
when you damn well please."

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,432
Here's an idea. What say
you stop showing up altogether

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,954
and we'll replace you
with a giant time clock?

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,359
If we ever miss you,

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,000
we'll just have a Bob Kelso
cuckoo bird pop out

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,392
every few minutes and say,
"I've never satisfied a woman."

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,074
Come on, Ted.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,958
<i>Dr Cox didn't know he was</i>
<i>the father of Jordan's baby,</i>

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,031
<i>but they were getting along better.</i>

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,475
- I love you.
- I love you.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,955
<i>As for us, it was</i>
<i>the end of our second year,</i>

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,315
<i>and each day</i>
<i>had begun to feel the same.</i>

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,911
<i>After a while, your residency</i>
<i>boils down to just a few things.</i>

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>Paperwork.</i>

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,792
<i>The three prescriptions</i>
<i>every patient gets.</i>

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,677
Acetaminophen for her headache,

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,558
Restoril so she'll sleep,
and Colace so she'll poop.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,631
<i>Paperwork.</i>

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,675
<i>Mind-numbing monotony.</i>

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,638
<i>And, of course, paperwork.</i>

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,428
<i>As for the patients...</i>

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,875
Look, because it's diabetes-related,

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,838
the pain in your foot
isn't responding to pain killers.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,229
I'd like to try
an anti-seizure medication

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,117
before we consider amputation.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,998
Good, because I have
an audition for <i>Stomp</i> tomorrow.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,992
Look, just cut
the damn thing off, will ya?

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,469
<i>That's why I'm so psyched</i>
<i>our college buddy,</i>

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,039
<i>Spence, was coming to town.</i>

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,031
- Jill Anderson.
- Yes.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,111
- No.
- Monica Meyer.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,236
- Yeah.
- Yes.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,276
I don't think
it's appropriate for us

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,749
to be rehashing
our college sexual conquests

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,592
with Carla in the other room.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,477
- Leslie Stevens.
- Yes!

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,154
On a pile of coats
with hundreds of people around.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,798
<i>What a whore!</i>

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,110
Who else?
Who else did you bang?

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,510
Carla, college wasn't
all sex and coats.

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,273
Spence here got me through
a lot of hard times.

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,630
Why don't you just
mousse the crap out of it?

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,995
Straight up.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,069
Yes.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,551
- My life changed that day.
- Man, that was a long time ago.

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,269
Now you two are engaged,
I'm in town because two frat brothers

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,793
are getting married.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,917
- A double wedding?
- No.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,952
Good for the boys.

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,396
The point is, we've really grown up.

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,271
That's good, good sauce.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,590
Check it out.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,272
Free pitcher.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,273
What I've got you on
is D-five half normal saline

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,635
with 20 KCL
at 100ccs an hour.

65
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,870
The Cadillac of all hangover cures.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,633
- It feels warm in my tummy.
- Good morning, angels.

67
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,188
Did you have one too many
Daiquiris last night?

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,670
- Spence, this is Dr Cox and...
- Don't bother. Don't care.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,479
He's the scary man
you told me about last night.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,074
- Hey, congratulations.
- For what, jackass?

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,709
- You just had a baby.
- No, she just had a baby.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,678
But you said it was his.
And you said something else.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,877
- That he didn't know it yet.
- That's exactly right.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,078
<i>Holy crap.</i>
<i>Run away. Run away. Run away.</i>

75
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,794
<i>OK, he hasn't said a word</i>
<i>in over ten minutes.</i>

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,836
<i>The hell with it. I'm going in.</i>

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,035
Dr Cox...

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,998
If the next words aren't
"See you," the third will be,

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,640
"My crotch,
you've punched me in the crotch."

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,119
See you.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,269
- How about that guy?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,429
- That guy?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,511
Maybe it would be easier
if I told you

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,636
whose butt I haven't
had my fingers in.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,711
That's a perk you never hear about.

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,234
You guys landed your dream jobs, huh?

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,072
<i>Dream job.</i>

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,359
Hey, man, how am I supposed
to finish this memo?

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,795
I don't know.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,430
Do you have
any interesting patients?

91
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,592
Mr Weinberg has dementia
but still enjoys his ronking.

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,557
- What's ronking?
- Ronk!

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,359
- Interesting.
- Hey, sweetness.

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,796
- Ronk.
- When do people yell "stat"?

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,792
Kinda never. Bambi, rounds.

96
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,634
- Dammit.
- Run, Johnny, run.

97
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,077
- Trying to add a little drama.
- I felt it.

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,312
<i>This is not a good day</i>
<i>to be late.</i>

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,231
<i>Every year,</i>
<i>Kelso picks a resident</i>

100
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,470
<i>to ride mercilessly</i>
<i>until they crumble.</i>

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,075
<i>The key is to jump on any easy</i>
<i>question and impress him early.</i>

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,628
- Right, shall we get started?
- Yes!

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,030
- Excuse me?
- Should we get started? Yes.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,792
Wow...

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,475
Dr Reid, do an ABG
on bed four without waking him.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,632
Dr... Young Asian Fellow,

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,790
bed seven needs a central line.

108
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,758
Dr Murphy and Dr Eager Beaver,
step forward.

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,957
<i>This is it. Last man standing.</i>

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,713
What are the four
differential diagnoses

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,155
of the persistent ST elevation
on any EKG?

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,514
- Dorian.
- Ischemia.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,749
- Murphy.
- Aneurysm.

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,989
- Dorian.
- Pericarditis.

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,071
- Murphy.
- Pass.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,392
<i>Ah, Doug. At least you're going</i>
<i>to a more chocolaty place.</i>

117
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,516
Dr Murphy.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,238
Ronk!

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,279
Dr Reid! A moment, please.

120
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,798
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

121
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,270
Every time I turn around,
Dr Kelso's riding me.

122
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,557
I've got next. What's up?

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,108
No one? Self-five.

124
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,111
For the big dog.

125
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,716
Look, Elliot,
I've seen this before.

126
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,270
Kelso worries he's not scary,
so he picks somebody to be his bitch.

127
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,157
Who he picks is totally random.

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,549
Unless you throw
a needle in his face.

129
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,996
OK, I didn't tell you the kid
was yours and you're upset.

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,517
I get it. But you seem to be
making a really big deal out of this.

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,068
Is there something else
that's bothering you?

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,435
It's mostly just the kid thing.

133
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,114
I didn't want you
to feel pressured to be with me.

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,236
I didn't want you
to feel manipulated.

135
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,038
I am so, so sorry,

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,157
but no matter what you say,
you don't have a leg to stand on.

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,231
I don't know about that, Perry.

138
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,312
Sounds like she's trying
to protect your relationship.

139
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,119
Some mothers say the only way
to get a guy to marry you

140
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,350
- is by using pregnancy as a trap.
- What?

141
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,431
Stupid mothers
who got even meaner

142
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,476
when they stopped drinking.

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,038
Morning.

144
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,714
- I make more than you do.
- What?

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,758
I saw your paycheck.
I make more than you do.

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,832
- Quite a bit more.
- You couldn't have seen it.

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,354
No way I could access
the personnel files.

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,873
Just impossible.

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,316
By the way, 987654320.

150
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,756
- My Social Security number.
- No. That's your PIN number.

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,674
- No, my PIN number is 3674.
- Bingo.

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,671
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

153
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,671
to have a janitor
make more than you?

154
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,558
Johnny. Investment banker.
So, no.

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,076
Why, Christopher?

156
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,559
I've saved up 500 bucks.

157
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,870
Where would you put that
if you were me?

158
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,518
A wallet, a money clip.

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,990
You could get Schmitty and Dan
a wedding gift. Dan wants a ferret.

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,310
- Ferrets are nice.
- They're mean.

161
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,994
Let's go do something
special tonight. My treat.

162
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,039
We gotta kinda lay low tonight.
We're on backup call.

163
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,078
See, now, this is
the proper way to lay low.

164
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,594
I mean, honestly,
does it get any better?

165
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,955
No, it does not.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,070
Why do you keep looking at me
like that?

167
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,071
People.

168
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,349
Ed, did you turn on
the jets in the hot tub?

169
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,750
- No.
- It's too hot on my eyes!

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,514
Those sutures look awful,
don't you think, Ted?

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,956
I don't know, sir. Yes? No?
I'm barely here.

172
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,033
I know what you're doing, sir,
the whole keep-us-scared thing.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,795
- I'm OK with it.
- Dr Reid.

174
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,077
Even if you hadn't
just missed blinding me earlier,

175
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,196
I still would've picked you
to crap on.

176
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,556
You're easily startled,
you're constantly overwhelmed.

177
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,959
While you work hard,

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,032
you still struggle to break
into the middle of the pack.

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,716
I chose you because I am hoping
that you will ask yourself,

180
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,873
really ask yourself, if there
isn't some other profession

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,269
you might be better suited for.

182
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,753
In the meantime, be a doll
and re-suture that wound.

183
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,317
Wanna get a beer later?

184
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,031
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

185
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,192
And while we're coming
completely clean, Perry,

186
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,431
I'm not the girl they're
singing about in <i>My Sharona.</i>

187
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,999
Her name's Sharona.

188
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,390
- You're making jokes?
- I just want this to be OK.

189
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,994
Don't get me wrong.
I wanna be with the kid.

190
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,275
I'm damn sure gonna
be with the kid.

191
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,430
But as far as you and I go...

192
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,558
...I just don't see us working out.

193
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,119
Nothing like cold beers
in a Jacuzzi. Am I right, Ed?

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,273
Some days I sit out here for hours,
downing cold one after cold one.

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,669
What do you do
when you have to pee?

196
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,231
- So you boys are doctors, huh?
- OK, whoa, Frannie.

197
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,833
That was my ass.

198
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,596
- You guys have to go to work?
- No, it's just a stupid intern.

199
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,877
The only way we have to go in
is if there was some catastrophe.

200
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,953
<i>In breaking news, there's been a</i>
<i>multiple car pile-up on the throughway.</i>

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,833
Plus, the two guys on call

202
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,514
would have to be
simultaneously incapacitated.

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,994
This is my chance to shine.

204
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,033
What's up, <i>chica?</i> Whoa!

205
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,997
Oh, God!

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,635
<i>Part of being a doctor is learning</i>
<i>to deal with the unexpected.</i>

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,238
<i>Whether it's someone</i>
<i>who won't take no for an answer.</i>

208
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,073
I've decided not to accept
the being-dumped thing.

209
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,549
I'm gonna hang around
until you forgive me.

210
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,831
<i>Or being shaken</i>
<i>to your very core.</i>

211
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,477
<i>Sometimes it's just having to work</i>
<i>in wet grundies.</i>

212
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,951
Hey, Betty, Wilma. What the hell?
You're only 40 minutes late.

213
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,477
- Do I smell beer?
- We had a few.

214
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,233
Newsflash: you can't drink
and then come to work.

215
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,914
- You're not airline pilots.
- Look, Dr Cox...

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,276
No, you look. If someone had
asked me just this morning,

217
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,954
is there any way that
I could have any less respect

218
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,430
for you two geniuses, I would
have said, that's not possible.

219
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,432
Lo and behold, you pulled it off.
Congratulations.

220
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,159
The only problem is
I'm fresh out of blue ribbons,

221
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,958
so instead you'll have to settle

222
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,600
for a lifetime supply
of my foot up your ass.

223
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,594
Go home.
You're not fit to work tonight.

224
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,355
Great speech.
You guys are in trouble.

225
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,829
Wait up, I've got my heels on.

226
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,358
<i>After what happened, I was</i>
<i>in no mood to be messed with.</i>

227
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,431
Hey, Food Stamps.

228
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,758
Little anonymous donation

229
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,150
from a guy who makes a little
more scratch than you.

230
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,754
You know what?
At least what I do matters. OK?

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,593
You're cleaning the same spot
you were this morning.

232
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,478
The smart money says
you'll be cleaning it tomorrow.

233
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,152
Why don't I just come by then,

234
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,879
and you can tell me
how what you do day after day

235
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,316
makes even the slightest bit
of difference in this world?

236
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,394
Too mean.

237
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,189
<i>I don't care if I hurt his feelings,</i>
<i>I got absolutely crushed tonight.</i>

238
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,431
<i>Turk and I both knew</i>
<i>who was responsible for all this.</i>

239
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,679
Crockett.

240
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,557
Tubbs.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,558
When do we eat?

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,394
Jordan, could you just give me
ten seconds to myself here?

243
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,479
No.

244
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,437
You know,
you are being very immature

245
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,670
and, oh, my God, is that guy on fire?

246
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,760
Dr Cox,
I'm so glad you're here.

247
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,956
From one hell to another.

248
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,076
Dr Kelso's been torturing me lately.

249
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
I thought I could handle it.
I've come a long way.

250
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,155
I was afraid of you,
and now I can talk to you,

251
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,198
like how your hair's
been looking springy lately,

252
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,953
not like the season,
like the inside of a mattress.

253
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,679
I don't have any clue
what you mean.

254
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,231
Dr Kelso's starting to get to me,

255
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,356
and I don't think
I can take it anymore.

256
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,274
Sorry, kid, but I'm dealing
with my own stuff right now.

257
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,828
Thanks a lot...really.

258
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,595
Howdy, Mop-Top.

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,871
Oh, God.

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,315
Man, why'd you even show up
this weekend?

261
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,949
What are you talking about?
I introduced Schmitty and Dan.

262
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,554
OK, I didn't really
introduce them.

263
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,269
I'm the one who accidentally
saw them under the foosball table.

264
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,833
Oh, Schmitty.

265
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,433
Typical Spence.

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,193
You just blow into town
and get us into trouble.

267
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,555
What?
I made you guys go out tonight?

268
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,029
Hey, I have a presentation
on Thursday.

269
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,588
Ask me if I'll go out
drinking Wednesday night.

270
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,671
- You wanna go out...?
- Sorry.

271
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,115
I can't, I have a presentation.

272
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,794
The truth is, you've been
complaining about work

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,270
since the second I got here,
dying for an excuse to blow it off.

274
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,318
So maybe you should stop being
all mad at me when, really,

275
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,392
you're just pissed
because you hate your jobs.

276
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,395
Every time I turn around,
Kelso's there.

277
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,471
Ted, he's trying to break my spirit.

278
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,154
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,389
I'm sorry. Of course you do.

280
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,552
Dr Reid, I'm afraid
that nothing you've described

281
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,198
constitutes harassment.

282
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,271
Swing and a miss, eh, Dr Reid?

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,193
The next time you decide
to make a stink over nothing,

284
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,953
you should see a lawyer
who didn't need five tries

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,598
to pass the bar exam.

286
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,959
I have stress-induced dyslexia
and you know that, Dr Oslek.

287
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,551
- Why are you doing this?
- I'll tell you why, Perry.

288
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,200
We've been dancing the same
dance for years now.

289
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,918
One gets angry and walks away,

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,195
the other's too stubborn
to go after them.

291
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,477
Before you know it, you sleep
with some pharmaceutical rep,

292
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,358
I'm convincing my mom
that the thing in my suitcase

293
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,398
is a giant electric melon-baller.
Guess what?

294
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,677
Things are different now.
We have a kid together.

295
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,389
I'm not going home until you promise
you're coming with me.

296
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,513
You go home.
I'll meet you there later.

297
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,192
Bring dinner.

298
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,034
You're a father.
Can you believe it?

299
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,308
Nope.

300
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,148
<i>I didn't get a lot of sleep thinking</i>
<i>about what Spence had said.</i>

301
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,950
Look, I'm sorry I was
such a jerk yesterday. OK?

302
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,430
Come on, look at this floor.
You could practically eat off of it.

303
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,118
- Would you?
- Would I what?

304
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,952
Would you eat off the floor?

305
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,759
<i>As I bent down to eat</i>
<i>that peppered floor turkey,</i>

306
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,195
<i>unaware that the cleanser</i>
<i>the janitor uses</i>

307
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,637
<i>is an extremely potent diuretic,</i>
<i>I realised something.</i>

308
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,075
<i>The reason we're doctors</i>
<i>is because we have</i>

309
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,151
<i>an innate desire to help people.</i>

310
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,231
That was disgusting.

311
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,912
<i>You have to have that desire,</i>

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,036
<i>because at the end</i>
<i>of your second year,</i>

313
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,430
<i>it's impossible to see the light</i>
<i>at the end of the tunnel.</i>

314
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,715
<i>So it becomes</i>
<i>about perseverance.</i>

315
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,398
<i>And fortitude.</i>

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,991
<i>And sacrifice.</i>

317
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,196
Sorry you guys
can't make the wedding.

318
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,679
Give them a big kiss for us.

319
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,479
Tell them the ferret
only eats fresh vegetables.

320
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,551
I'm gonna miss you guys.

321
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,591
- I'll see ya later.
- Later, dude.

322
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,077
<i>Really, all you can hope for</i>
<i>is an occasional thank-you.</i>

323
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,071
I'm so glad the medication worked.

324
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,232
I'm supposed to be happy
cos somebody did something right?

325
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,469
<i>You're welcome.</i>

326
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,755
Nice call on the anti-seizure medicine.

327
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,833
I'm starting to think you may not be
the worst resident that ever lived.

328
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,795
- How cool was that?
- Shut up.

329
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,996
You shut up.
You're an angry man.

330
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,032
Sorry I didn't tell you about
the "lt's your baby" thing.

331
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,190
We'll probably talk
about that later.

332
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,192
- I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
- No?

333
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,759
I was scared.

334
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,118
I was freaking out, cos I'm confident
that I'll be a horrible father.

335
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,792
You? Come on.

336
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,269
You're gonna be a very scary...
I mean, great.

337
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,998
You're gonna be a great father.

338
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,277
Last night, you totally kicked
our asses cos we deserved it.

339
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,750
Remember you told me I wasn't
the worst resident that ever lived?

340
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,034
Eight seconds ago?

341
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,475
You have no idea how
much that meant to me.

342
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,597
I said, I think you may not
be the worst resident ever,

343
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,195
but I can't be sure of stuff like that.
I haven't done the legwork.

344
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,236
You're always there
when we need you.

345
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,709
I think you have
this fathering thing down.

346
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,791
Why am I not leaving, Dr Reid?

347
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,836
I don't want
to miss you breaking down

348
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,717
and weeping
in front of everyone.

349
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,920
Here it comes. Great big tears.
Great big crocodile tears.

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,993
If she was your daughter,
you'd totally know how to handle it.

351
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,917
My God, you're right.

352
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,516
- You're doing fine, Barbie.
- Thank you.

353
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,875
Everybody have a good one.

354
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,030
I'm going home to see my son.

355
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,996
Excuse me there, Bobbo.

356
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,675
Right in the nose. Yeah.

357
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,951
<i>That may come up tomorrow.</i>

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
