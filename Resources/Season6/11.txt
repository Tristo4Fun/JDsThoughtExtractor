00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:03,011
<i>On slow day like this we all find ways to pass the time</i>

2
00:00:03,057 --> 00:00:05,202
<i>We all find ways to pass the time</i>

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:06,959
<i>Dr.Cox tortured the interns...</i>

4
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:08,380
Allright now children,

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:10,821
I know your shifts are over
and you're all excited

6
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:13,734
about going home, but first we're
going to play a little game,

7
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:17,658
called "Answer the question
correctly, or stay here forever".

8
00:00:17,886 --> 00:00:22,221
To you Abby, what are the neoplastic
causes of hyperprolactenemia?

9
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:26,464
Uhm, a topic tumor production,
secondary to renal carcinoma?

10
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,922
Close, but no siggy...

11
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,845
You'll be staying here forever.

12
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:34,404
- Dude, you think that was all too mean?
- No.

13
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:37,963
Wrong, it damn sure was.
You're staying here forever.

14
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:41,659
And Kenyan Intern, Kenya-answer me this:
[Kenya->Can ya->Can you]

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,172
Is it even possible to give
the right answer in this game?

16
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,554
- No.
- Correct!

17
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:50,703
- Yes!
- Unfortunately,

18
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:54,225
you're still staying here forever.
My game, my rules.

19
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:55,106
Come!

20
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,866
<i>Elliot and Carla enjoyed the common practice of dividing up</i>

21
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,129
<i>the stuff left behind when patient dies...</i>

22
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:04,740
Score! Haa, I'm going to have Keith give
me these later, in front of people.

23
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:07,734
Look if I use this ready thing to turn
Turk off when I'm not in the mood.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,460
- This is go--
- Whaaat?!

25
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:12,630
Oh my God!

26
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:15,800
Mrs. Sommers we're so sorry, we
thought that you were dead.

27
00:01:16,153 --> 00:01:18,128
Yours...be right back.

28
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,321
<i>And the janitor was killing time the way he always does.</i>

29
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,055
Crash cart to bed 3. Step!

30
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,954
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha haaa!

31
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,701
- We gotcha!
- Ha ha ha ha.

32
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:35,303
He's not really dying. I made a device
that makes the sound of a flatline.

33
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,499
It also makes that Beep-Beep sound of a truck

34
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,242
backing up, I used that on people who are...

35
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:40,576
sensitive about their weight!

36
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:42,501
I'm sure it's a blyast.

37
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,213
Ok, i put on a few,

38
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,445
but my son's new fiancee Kenny owns a

39
00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:49,914
Cinnabon franchise, what
the hell am I supposed to do?

40
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,012
As for Turk and I, we just checked on a patient

41
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,759
who had a pig valve installed in his heart,

42
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:56,837
which sparked a lively medical debate:

43
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,057
So, if you could have any
animal part, what would it be?

44
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,822
- That's easy!
- Besides an elephant's penis.

45
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:03,407
Hold, I need a sec.

46
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,295
Whale's blowhole.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,069
In that way when I'm playing
submarine in the bathtub

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,628
I would never have to came up for air.

49
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:11,791
That's cool...

50
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,517
Wanna know what animal parts I'd want?

51
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,102
<i>I could guess.</i>

52
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,589
Man, there's no milk for my coffee!

53
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:21,033
Say no more.

54
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,779
-Thanks, Pal!
-Welcome.

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,575
- You know what'd go great with that coffee?
- What's that?

56
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,464
*Turk screams*

57
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,813
-Turky Bacon!
-Yep!

58
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:40,358
-You'd be like a big breakfast machine!
-Yeah.

59
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:44,056
Finally something happened that broke the monotony

60
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:45,430
This guy from the E.R.,

61
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,362
tried to kill himself, by jumping off a building.

62
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:50,097
Let's go people, in the hand.

63
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:55,804
{\an8}*The Janitor faking truck back sound*

64
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,804
I'm hiring a trainer, dammit!

00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,736
<i>When a patient regains consciousness
from a head trauma</i>

72
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,290
<i>the first order of business is simple:</i>

73
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,439
You know what your name is?

74
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:23,296
I...I don't remember...

75
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:27,567
Ok, well usually in this type of
situation we'd refer to you as Jonh Doe,

76
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,285
but I think that's so unpersonal...

77
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:31,905
I'm gonna call you Roger Templeton

78
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,118
I'm just kidding. Found your wallet,
your name is really Roger Templeton

79
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:40,698
A little memory loss humour. Ok, no? Allright...

80
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:45,277
Uhm...I think what you probably have
is a little temporal retrograde amnesia,

81
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,646
very common in this sort of injury,
what you need is go and get some rest.

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,379
Amnesia? But what he said when you
told him he tried to commit suicide?

83
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,411
- I didn't tell him.
- Oh, he doesn't need

84
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:56,408
to deal with that right now.

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,557
Halt! Maybe we should never tell him.

86
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:02,037
<i>I know I'd love to forget all the painful
things that have happened to me.</i>

87
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:05,591
<i>But unfortunately I keep replaying
them into my head like some flip-show</i>

88
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,631
<i>or a bad sit-com, too lazy to
come up with a fresh story.</i>

89
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,046
Aaagh!

90
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,705
<i>That's odd.</i>

91
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,401
Uuh! Agh!

92
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,350
- Aah!
- Ouch!

93
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,271
- Ah!
- Ok, JD?

94
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,652
Yes?

95
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,154
Aaah!

96
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,598
Hold it!

97
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:04,297
Ough!

98
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:10,810
Mmh...Aagh!

99
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,265
Ghaa!

100
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,846
Oh no!

101
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:25,934
Ooh hey!

102
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:27,207
Ahi!

103
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,684
Wha--?!

104
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,655
So you're saying you'd be just fine

105
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,348
waking up one morning having
forgotten parts of your life?

106
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,158
No, just the bad stuff.

107
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,152
Like the Matrix sequels,

108
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:48,721
and that time we went skiing
and I got my lip most stuck

109
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,622
- in the zipper of my puffy coat?
- Uh, ah...

110
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,867
There are so many moments
in my life I will never forget.

111
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,318
Oh, like that time my dad accidentally
glued my mum's legs together

112
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,474
after testing out his new
homemade sex lube.

113
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:01,702
Your dad's awesome!

114
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,927
<i>There are certainly been a lot
of hard moments around here...</i>

115
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,482
<i>and for some reason whenever
I think about them,</i>

116
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,140
<i>The Fray is always playing.</i>

117
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:10,995
...which we've already viewed, it's just a...

118
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,923
<i>No, not that Fray song.</i>

119
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,185
<i>This Fray song.</i>

120
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:31,939
Wow! What the...

121
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:35,688
This is the reason why your
headache didn't go away.

122
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,406
That's actually pronounced

123
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,076
"Analgesic", not "Anal G-sick",

124
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,825
sir, the pills go in your mouth.

125
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:46,165
You know, I actually like do it, so
don't do that make me always do.

126
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,798
If you're a friend of the
game "Find the Saltine",

127
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,004
relax, I won't play it
with Turk anymore.

128
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:52,783
Behind your ear.

129
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,506
My friend, you have
found the saltine.

130
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,996
Ah, don't tell Elliott
we're still playing.

131
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:01,415
When did you meet
Morgan Freeman?

132
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,529
That's my mom.

133
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,962
Ok, I still wanna referee
to a dermatologist, but...

134
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:09,662
It looks benigne, I mean...

135
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,122
Yeam. Neither have.

136
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,130
You know why?

137
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,985
It's not beacuse I have the name
"Johnny" tattooed on my butt,

138
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,916
isn't all the senior buddy, if you went
through all we did you'd understand.

139
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,727
- Have you been drinking?
- Am I drunk?

140
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,214
Why is your pancake in
the silverware drawer?

141
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,891
You mean why is that silverware
in the pancake drawer?

142
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:31,720
Oh-oh!

143
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,624
Hey, those nuts are
for my brother,

144
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,786
please don't eat 'em all.

145
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,066
Aaaargh!

146
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,872
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET, CARLA?

147
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:46,190
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR?!

148
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,933
You want me to ask how this's real?

149
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:49,880
You know, when I was a kid,

150
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:52,785
I had my first sex dream
with that Mr. Booper.

151
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,203
At least, I think it was a sex dream...

152
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,576
he was trying to choke me.

153
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,821
Well either this kid
as a lightbulb up his butt,

154
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,698
or his colon has a great idea.

155
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,701
I know, you're right.

156
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,770
I was an idiot about these
shower shorts.

157
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:07,751
I mean, it's not like they come with
their complementary shower wallet

158
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,078
Auh!

159
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:11,888
Shower shorts?

160
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:16,142
For the man who has nothing
to hide, but still wants to.

161
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,601
Did your other actually
experimenting with the drug

162
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:23,485
that can erase stuff from your head,
like memories, dreams...

163
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,280
I don't remember any
of my dreams anyway.

164
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,029
Except for the ones involving cheese,

165
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,139
and Tyra Banks.

166
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,135
Oh, baby, don't worry.

167
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:33,554
You've nothing to be threatened by.
In my book it goes...

168
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:34,755
Cheese...

169
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:35,607
You...

170
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:36,778
Tyra.

171
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,523
Well, I know one person who's not down
with the racing deams, right J.D.?

172
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,029
<i>I was already gone.</i>

173
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,927
All inferiority complex, Batman.

174
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,913
How low is my self esteem, that I'm
the sidekick in my own fantasy.

175
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:52,626
It could be worse, Robin.

176
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,254
You could be Alfred the Butler.

177
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:55,957
Damn you...

178
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,771
Sir.

179
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,809
Kronk, where you go now?

180
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,592
Oh, hey, you're up.

181
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:22,254
I've got a ton of bricks
for Dr. Dorian.

182
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,715
Is it hot in here?

183
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,479
It is like...it's hot.

184
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,833
Yeah, I've got something to
say to Dr. Cox,

185
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,722
Immanna give you the
best in my evaluation,

186
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,982
that you ever did see.

187
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:01,730
And this Friday, at the
Steel Cage Metal Slam,

188
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,240
Immonna give you a physical,

189
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,917
that you ain't ever gonna forget.

190
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,877
Immonna probie you,

191
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,491
cause I'm the intern.

192
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,531
Weh! Weh! Weh!

193
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:18,547
Answer me.

194
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:20,431
...it's all made boobs.

195
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,867
There they are!

196
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,124
Bring it on, bitch.

197
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:30,945
And as you can see,

198
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,577
the ass is on the front

199
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:38,068
You miss this spot.

200
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,824
Oohh, whack a Newbie

201
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,026
-Wow! Damn! Ooh!
- You missed me!

202
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,652
I don't like the way I look.
I don't like the way I feel.

203
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:00,637
I don't like the way I feel about how I look

204
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:02,303
There's so much bad.

205
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,308
my boobs are too low, my
body's too big and I'm not sure.

206
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:15,923
Aamm!

207
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,752
Hey man, how I'm supposed to finish this memo?

208
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,891
JD?

209
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:30,729
I'm telling you, you guys should
daydream more often.

210
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:33,056
All you have to do is tilt your head to the left

211
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:37,032
and let your mind run free like an eeeagleeee...

212
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:40,517
<i>As I wondered if I looked
that stupid when I fantasize,</i>

213
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,463
<i>I decided to check on Mr. Templeton.</i>

214
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,178
<i>Unfortunately he was up and had a question.</i>

215
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:46,836
-How d'I get hurt?

216
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:48,432
<i>Damn it!</i>

217
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:55,230
So what d'you do?

218
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,276
I did what any good doctor would do,

219
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,090
I turn up his morphine drip
so he'd go back to sleep.

220
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,184
Oh, you guys, look out you here...
this lady is very serious condition.

221
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,703
You've all...heard about my...flat line device?

222
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:13,862
Yep?!

223
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:17,074
Ok, well, forgive me for trying
to live things up around here

224
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:18,700
by faking an old stranger's death.

225
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,679
Plan B...let's dance!

226
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:28,618
* "Diner" by Martin Sexton *

227
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,094
Hey, you.

228
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:33,169
- Yes or no!
- What?

229
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,327
That's a new game: "yes or no".

230
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,175
- No..
- Wrong!

231
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,243
Now you have to stay here forever. Go!

232
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,125
<i>I couldn't help being reminded of</i>

233
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,259
<i>all the mean thing we've done
to each other over the years...</i>

234
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,179
<i>And I realised that if I replayed the
moments in my head back to back</i>

235
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,059
<i>I could probably kill another couple of minutes.</i>

236
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,784
You went to four years of college

237
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,944
and four years of medical school,

238
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:59,829
so I can safely presume
that you're at least eight.

239
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,479
Newbie,

240
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,004
the only way you could be
less productive right now

241
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,948
is if you were in fact the wall
on what you're leaning against.

242
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:12,218
Of course then you'd be providing
some jackass with a wall

243
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:15,274
in which to lean against and reflect
on what a jackass he truly is.

244
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,358
Hey wait a sec, we want do stuff to you.

245
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,666
- Aaah! Aaah!
- Waaaaa!

246
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:24,233
Ha ha ha haaa!

247
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,253
- Don't do that annoying thing
- What annoying thing?

248
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,076
- You know, when you talk.
- Come on that's a little--

249
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:30,864
See, there it is. How does
that not drive you crazy?

250
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,472
Thank you, each time you call me
a girl's name I die a little bit inside.

251
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,382
Hey, Girlsname.

252
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:38,171
Do you know how I know
that this is yours, Farrah?

253
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:38,734
Mary?

254
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,951
My gal Friday.

255
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,018
You know, Sandy isn't this

256
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,872
- sort of girl name.
- Is a short for Sandra.

257
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:43,347
Fiona.

258
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,115
Tiny Dancer.

259
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:44,710
Frodo.

260
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,144
Beth.

261
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:45,625
Vivian.

262
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:46,774
Interview with Sabrina?

263
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:47,243
Carol.

264
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:47,982
Skitch.

265
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,355
I don't go to hell, she'd care of it?

266
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,331
Murder, she wrote.

267
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,132
<i>Gladys! Ginger! Tiffany! No. Cheryl!
Betsy...Betsy! Mmh! that's new!</i>

268
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,202
Betsy, good morning!

269
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,731
Oh, I get it. I'm a girl.

270
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:00,373
- Could you be a bigger ass right now?
- Could you have a bigger ass right now?

271
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:05,206
I'm assuming, since you already went
ahead and took everything else,

272
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,411
that you're here for my self respect,

273
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:10,676
but there's bad news on
that one, sweet cheecks,

274
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:14,449
I already gave it to your mom when she begged me to marry ya!

275
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,752
Ha ha ha haa!

276
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,037
Oh, I wouldn't have room for it, anyway,
what with your testicles in my trophy case.

277
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,655
- Sir, I'm confused.
- You annoy me.

278
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:22,593
Oh, now I get it.

279
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:28,497
Hey champ, what has two thumbs and doesn't
give a crap? Bob Kelso. How you doin'?

280
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,729
Janitor? Have you ever looked at yourself
and wished that you were different

281
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,134
-  in every single way?
- Naah...I'm a winner.

282
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,897
Does this shade of red make
me look like a clown?

283
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,732
No, Barbie, no...

284
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:48,368
It makes you look like a prostitute
who caters exclusively to clowns.

285
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:53,560
Fuck!

286
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:54,252
Frick!

287
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:55,237
Double frick!

288
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,044
Owww!

289
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:58,369
Yeow!

290
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,070
Anybody got any extra ketchup packets?

291
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,369
Thank you, Elliot.

292
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,375
- You're a jerk.
- You are a jerk.

293
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,182
- Jackass!
- Bite me.

294
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,589
Great guy!

295
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,759
After all, I'm-I'm the waste kid!

296
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:13,525
You're now!

297
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:18,650
Anyway, Noobie, the reason I came down here
was to tell you that Mr Take-the-easy-way-out

298
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,912
was awake again, and he wants to
know why his lips taste like asphalt.

299
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,304
Somebody's gotta go in and tell him.

300
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:26,909
I'll go do it.

301
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:33,595
<i>We all knew Dr.Cox was right, because
the truth is...it's all of your memories,</i>

302
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:38,275
<i>the joyful ones, and the heart-breaking
ones, that make up who we are as a person.</i>

303
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,815
* when i feel like i might fall *

304
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:48,128
* underneath the pressure of it all *

305
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,814
* i think of you *

306
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:52,550
You know, I don't care what you think.

307
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,576
- Shit, you do?
- No.

308
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:04,290
Look, i wanna be like you...
but a more successful you.

309
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:10,645
- Are you crying?
- No...I don't know.

310
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm just completely hormonal.

311
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:18,269
I mean, you try going from out-of-control
horny to clinically depressed 6 times a day.

312
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,778
Oh, gimme a break, I can't knock
that out on the way to work.

313
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,420
Hey, lady, I'm proud of
what you're doing here.

314
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,080
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

315
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:34,408
Look, man, it was one second of doubt, ok?

316
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:36,130
Since when do you care

317
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:40,049
- what everyone else thinks?
- I don't. I care what you think.

318
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,005
<i>Then i witnessed one of those moments</i>

319
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:46,209
<i>that let me know in my heart that
these two will be together forever.</i>

320
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:48,813
who cares?

321
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:52,931
We're having a baby.

322
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,707
- We're having a baby.
- Yeah, we are.

323
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:01,493
- A baby. A little you.
- Yeah, and with a lot of you.

324
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,530
There's one more thing

325
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,628
- you have to do for me.
- You can't keep me from getting drunk.

326
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,533
You have to forgive yourself for
everything that went down the other day.

327
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:15,950
- God, you're...you're so annoying.
- Yeah.

328
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:20,068
- Okay.
- Good.

329
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:25,581
Now, where's your camera, aren't you...
aren't you gonna take some pictures?

330
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,402
- Pictures of what?
- You know, crying babies

331
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,358
covered in chocolate, people singing
Happy Birthday to my son

332
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,432
who they've never even met him before,
you know, the-the whole routine!

333
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,174
Where do you think we are?

334
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:58,900
I guess i came over here to tell you

335
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:05,942
how proud of you I am. Not because you
did the best you could for those patients.

336
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,982
But because after twenty
years of being a doctor...

337
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:15,683
when things go badly you
still take it this hard.

338
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:23,895
And I've gotta tell you man, I mean...
that's the kind of doctor I want to be.

339
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,897
It really has been an amazing
six years, hasn't it?

340
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:40,173
I wouldn't change a single moment, would you?

341
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:41,945
Oh, I damn sure would change this moment.

342
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:45,100
In fact, I'd change this moment and every
other moment you and I have ever had

343
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,872
that's even remotely like this moment.

344
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:51,282
- Turk, can i ask you a quick favour?
- I'm not giving you a hug.

345
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,500
<i>I hate this place.</i>
