00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,761
<i>Now that Elliot had
accepted Keith's proposal,</i>

2
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:04,469
it was time to start planning the wedding.

3
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:07,364
Ok, so I took a picture of the church
that we're gonna be married in.

4
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:09,624
Only imagine that the horse upfront

5
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,246
is actually a horse and a carriage,
and the people in the coffins are us.

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,806
- You... already picked the church?
- Yeah, I reserved it for the third week in July,

7
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,549
every year since I was nineteen.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,049
When I'll tell Father O'Neil that
I actually need it this time,

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,359
he's going to crap the communion cracker.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,148
Now, being that it's already
May, we have to decide

11
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,682
if we wanna get married in two
months, or in a year and two months.

12
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,430
<i>Women tend to hear one thing,
when men offer them wedding advices.</i>

13
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:34,187
<i>So when Keith said this:</i>

14
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:37,463
Elliot, two months isn't enough time
to plan a wedding.

15
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,338
<i>Elliot heard this:</i>

16
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:44,372
Go ahead, do whatever you
want, regardless of what I say.

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,067
Great! Two months it is!

18
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:55,604
God, I can't stop thinking about Elliot.

19
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:58,746
Dude! It's over, ok?
You guys had your chance.

20
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,960
She crushed you.
You crushed her.

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,361
It's always a train wreck.

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,792
- That was then!
- What's so different now?

23
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:06,177
She's getting married.

24
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:10,056
I don't know. I guess in the
back of my head I thought

25
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:14,014
even after all the hell we put each other
through, we might end up together, you know?

26
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:15,771
Yeah.

27
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:19,554
I mean... what if not being with Elliot
is the biggest mistake of my life?

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,851
You made bigger mistakes.

29
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:27,441
For tickets to see "Basic Istinct 2",
press the paddle key.

30
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,766
That one still stinks.

31
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:33,844
Yeah, she didn't even show her vajayjay.

32
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,019
Oh, it's on the DVD extras.
It's labelled "Vagina".

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,529
Look, hey, I'm ging to Phoenix
this weekend, for a surgical conference.

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,907
Why don't you come with me?
It'll probably take your mind off Elliot.

35
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,785
I don't know Turk.
Will I get my own room?

36
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:49,055
- We'll have to share.
- Then you know what my answer is.

37
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:54,488
On our way to Phoenix, yeah!

38
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,757
Hey, you know how in the movies
when a car get further and further away

39
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:01,758
you can still hear people talking like
they're right in front of the camera?

40
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,379
Yeah, that drives me crazy.

41
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,406
Hey! I want snacks for the trip.

42
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,743
Pringle? Oh, uhm, turn left here
to go on the freeway.

43
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,189
No, not yet. I gotta stop and go pee.

44
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,202
Already? I told you to go before we left.

51
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,941
Right time to hit the convention floor.

52
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:38,100
- You got your name tag?
- Yes, I do.

53
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:40,815
Me too.

54
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,072
It's full of extra security around here.

55
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,017
Every year, the same group
of rowdy doctors,

56
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:51,043
arrive and all they do is drink,
hit on women and trash the place.

57
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:53,274
Oh, God.

58
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:54,589
Here they are now.

59
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,918
Wassup, Phoenix!

60
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,566
Ohh, that's what I like about this town.

61
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:10,101
Hey there... Patrick!
Good to see you again, man.

62
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,084
Fetch!

63
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:16,304
Oh, Bob, would you hit that, huh?

64
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,313
What are you stoned? I wouldn't hit
that with Stottlemeyer's dong.

65
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:21,938
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

66
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,178
Out of my way, boys.

67
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,568
Me and my fellow chiefs of medicine
are gonna tear this bitch up.

68
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:31,807
One of those dudes is gonna
die this weekend.

69
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,872
- Come on. Let's go get you mind off Elliot.
- It's not that easy, T---

70
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:41,037
- Oh, my God. Is that who I think it is?
- Yep. Old MC.

71
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,198
I was saving it as a surprise.

72
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,221
He's only the best Young MC
impersonator on the circuit.

73
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:47,405
The man's a genius.

74
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,778
Let's get him to say:
"Bust a move!"

75
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,792
Dude, the guy spends year
after year on a convention circuit

76
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,332
saying that line, I'm pretty sure

77
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,388
- he's sick and tired to say it.
- You probably right.

78
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,611
"Bust a move, man!"

79
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,315
Hey, "Bust a move!"

80
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:02,798
- Bust a move, fellas!
- Aaah!

81
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,171
You bust a move! Old Young MC!

82
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,908
- Check me!
- Bust a move!

83
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,852
You're the one who should be busting moves!

84
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,045
I can die now.

85
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:15,057
<i>Elliot was wasting no time spreading
the word about her wedding.</i>

86
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,607
July 21st, save the date.

87
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,456
July 21st, save the date.

88
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,776
Oh, July 21st, save the date.

89
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:22,762
How is it going?

90
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,965
Ok, as your maid of honour,
I have to say that

91
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,129
2 months is not enough time
to plan a wedding!

92
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,302
Wait. I just realized.

93
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,157
You haven't even asked me
to be your maid of honour yet.

94
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,114
Oh my God, Carla, I've been too busy.
I've just assumed you knew that you were.

95
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,331
Ah, Carla?

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,378
Will you be my maid of honour?

97
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,673
Of course I will! You are my best friend!

98
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:50,429
Ah! Yeah! Ahahahah!

99
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:53,322
But seriously, do you realize how much work
goes into planning a wedding?

100
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:56,430
Ah, yeah! What do you think
I've been doing for the last ten years?

101
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,965
See, it's all in here.

102
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:01,584
Ah! There's the seating charts.

103
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,852
And the photographer that I reserved
every year under different alias.

104
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:05,551
Mmh!

105
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,808
Oh, and here is a photo of my wedding dress.

106
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,083
Which I'm totally going to fit into, thanks

107
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,271
to that awesome parasite
I got from eating sushi.

108
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,549
Oh. Hey, everyone!

109
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,150
I've been looking for
a new role playing game,

110
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,578
ever since my "Lord of the Rings" club
booted me for using an actual warhammer.

111
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,094
So, would anybody mind, if I pretended

112
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,161
to be the chief of medicine,
while Kelso is out of town?

113
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,282
Ah! Janitor you're a natural!

114
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:28,583
Fantastic!

115
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:31,090
Let's make cancer feel foolish.

116
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:34,977
Uh!

117
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,940
Save the date.

118
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,372
Oh, gosh! July 21...

119
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,701
It's a... it's a bit of a problem.

120
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,609
Why?

121
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:48,621
Because I wouldn't go to your wedding

122
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:50,762
if it was held in my very own backyard.

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,180
Hey! Can I bring a date?

124
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,528
Oh, what am I thinking?
I'll meet someone there!

125
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,702
And what the hell have you two
been doing all morning?

126
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:11,180
- You know...
- Meeting...

127
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,198
- Hip-hop girls...
- Greeting, we got these...

128
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,649
He gave some hip-hop hugs.

129
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:20,634
Say I was too nervous to hand that girl
over there, what advice would you give me?

130
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,010
- Bust a move!
- Ahah!

131
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,611
Alright, alright.
What if a great song comes on,

132
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,090
but I'm too shy to get down?
What should I do?

133
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,743
Bust a move!

134
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,861
You're awesome man!
What are you drinking? We'll buy you one.

135
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:34,280
Bust a move!

136
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,847
- You know, convention stuff.
- You know, convention stuff.

137
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,897
Look. Just because I get to spend the weekend

138
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:47,378
drinking beer with the guys and overpaying
the escorts so they'll do the weird stuff,

139
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,613
doesn't mean you two get to screw around!

140
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,805
Attend some lectures! Visit some booths!

141
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:54,965
Act like professionals, damn it!

142
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:56,984
Sir, we are being professional.

143
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,031
Yeah! We, we were coming over here...

144
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,980
just now to check out this booth
right here with the crapper!

145
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,563
Oh, wait, it's, it's much more than that.

146
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,808
If a patient has a bowel movement in it,

147
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,070
it immediately gives the diagnosis.

148
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,343
We call it, the Dr. Toilet!

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,732
Mr. Mimov, I wanted a second opinion,
so I've called in my colleague Dr. Toilet.

150
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,989
I agree.
The best course of action is dialysis.

151
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:26,875
Dr. Toilet, I'm sorry about the other day, uhm...

152
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:30,367
I've just had my morning coffee
and a bran muffin, it was...

153
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:35,090
kind of an emergency situation, I know
you were napping, but it was an accident.

154
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:39,128
An accident? Dr. Dorian, there are
48 other toilets in this hospital.

155
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,621
I'm the only one that's a doctor,
and then you came into my office

156
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,320
and you sat on me.

157
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,372
Didn't you hear me screaming to get off?

158
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,846
Roger, in my defence those
sounds were very muffled.

159
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,555
I thought they were coming from me!

160
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,668
You know what, John?
Let's just drop it and move on.

161
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,861
Janine, hold my calls. I'm gonna take a nap.

162
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,401
Sure thing, Dr. Toilet.

163
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,005
I wouldn't be able to help myself.

164
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:26,695
Hi, Gary, it's Elliot Reid. I know
that we haven't spoken since

165
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:29,297
you broke up with me in the 11th grade
but I just wanted to let you know

166
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,854
that I'm getting married. Oh, also I was
sorry to hear that you lost your legs.

167
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:37,314
I'm notifying all my old boyfriends today
that I'm officially off the market.

168
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,769
I'm sure the "pulse" setting on your
shower head will be devastated.

169
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,605
Look, blondie,

170
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:46,687
I've a cardiac patient who needs a perfusion
imaging and since your fancy private practice

171
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:49,539
has one of those spect cameras, I was
hoping just rather use it.

172
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,009
Sure. Just as long as you promise to come
to my wedding the cameras are all yours.

173
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,393
Why do you even care?

174
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,107
I know that we don't exactly
like each other but...

175
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:03,041
over the past 6 years you've become
a huge part of my life so...

176
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:04,684
I would love you to come.

177
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:10,074
Plus if you don't than table 14
would be boy girl boy girl girl

178
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,220
and that's insanity.

179
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:13,624
Jennifer next to Jennifer next to Najah...

180
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:17,849
Plus there's Bobby, put him next to her.
But at the end Bobby doesn't get along with Jennifer.

181
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:20,295
Yeah, camera no camera, please

182
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:24,092
consider this me checking the
"will not be attending" column:

183
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:26,323
Aah!

184
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,158
Sorry, Carla but i need you
to take care of this lab work.

185
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,064
Keith, I'm already covering three floors.
Can you believe this, Ted?

186
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,773
Aaah...h when..

187
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,431
people try to put me in the middle
of things my troath closes.

188
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,332
Listen here,  young doctor Gilchrist

189
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,323
Uh, that's not my name.

190
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,627
Gilchrist? Please.

191
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,406
She's not upset with you
because you asked her to help.

192
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,900
She's upset you insinuated
her job was less important.

193
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,515
He's actually right.

194
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,834
And you, nurse Ipanema.

195
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,839
Realize this is a young doctor under stress.

196
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:05,750
Ted, come along. We've much work to do.

197
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,872
Wait Ted, Ted, Ted? What are you doing?

198
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:11,262
I'm a follower.

199
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,905
Ok, when the lecture starts,

200
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:30,698
I'll start to choke and then you yell:
"Is there a doctor in the house?"

201
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,110
That's a good kill. Just be
careful, don't really choke,

202
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:34,332
- That wouldn't be funny.
- No.

203
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:39,382
Do you think if Elliot and I were still
dating we'd be getting married?

204
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,236
Dude, you gotta turn this off,
allright? We are on vacation,

205
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,917
there are plenty of hot girls here.

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,841
And single.

207
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,222
Turk,

208
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,982
Elliot getting married is a big deal for me.

209
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,743
It's not just one girl who's gonna
make me stop thinking about it.

210
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,494
Good afternoon.

211
00:10:56,264 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm doctor Briggs, and I'm lecturing
on the use of high dose radiation therapy

212
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:01,533
in prostate cancer.

213
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,411
<i>Except maybe the last girl I was in love with.</i>

214
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:10,030
To be honest with you, I can't make
Hedger tales out of these things.

215
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:13,265
When is this hospital gonna
get a tuned spect camera?

216
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:16,213
That is a very good point and I am on it, Ted?

217
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:17,959
Add that to the list.

218
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:21,950
I will check to see if the quaterly fiscals
can accomodate the financial comps.

219
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,330
I hope so.

220
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:25,451
Ted,

221
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:28,522
you do realize that was all jibberish. He's...

222
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:30,102
he's just pretending.

223
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,806
He can't make any real changes in this place.

224
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,327
Tell that to the new daycare program.

225
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:38,665
Hi, dad.

226
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:39,792
Jack?

227
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,544
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

228
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,276
- Oh, who's this?
- I don't know. Get out.

229
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,431
Hmmm...

230
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,718
You know, if you are still having problems
with that picture,

231
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,845
all you gotta do is agree to go to my
wedding, and you can use our camera.

232
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,934
Blondie, as attached as
I have indeed become to my patient,

233
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,530
his death due to my inability
to see a clear picture of his heart

234
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,906
would still be a preferable alternative

235
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:09,408
to actually having to hear you
utter your self-written vows:

236
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,455
"My dearest Keith,

237
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:17,524
my heart was like a vault but you
picked the lock like an apple thief

238
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,374
who picks the first golden
delicious of the fall harvest".

239
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,822
Ok, first of all stop reading my
wedding binder.

240
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:24,976
It's private.

241
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:26,309
And...

242
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:31,305
I cannot believe that you wouldn't wanna
come see me start my life with my soulmate.

243
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,689
Soulmate? Try 'last resort'.

244
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,186
Let's just be honest for two seconds here.

245
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,753
You basically lived in this dump
for the last six years

246
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:41,914
and there weren't that many guys
to choose from once you eliminate

247
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,394
the women and the gays,

248
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,315
the too old,

249
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:49,803
the too poor,

250
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,981
the ones who just barely beat the rap
for murdering their first wife,

251
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,281
and of course, Ted.

252
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,981
Noooooo!

253
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:01,849
Well then...

254
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,018
What's left?

255
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:10,789
As you can see here,

256
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,808
recurrents rates were significantly
diminished with the higher doses.

257
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:17,540
I can't believe Kim's here, I guess I
have to go talk to her.

258
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,155
And why is that a bad thing?

259
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,183
Uh, we've never spoken since the miscarriage.

260
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,062
She looks good. I think her
boobs got bigger.

261
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,766
Really? Let me see.

262
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,202
Yeah, you're right. Check it!

263
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,935
<i>As we sat there air-grooping my ex,</i>

264
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:40,450
<i>I wondered how things were
going back at the hospital.</i>

265
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,384
<i>Elliott was probably still giddy
about her engagement.</i>

266
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,892
So let me ask you this there, Barb.

267
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,047
Do you really wanna marry Keith?

268
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,713
Or do you just want to get married?

269
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,652
Uh, ok. That's... that's all I've got.
Thanks for barely listening.

270
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:07,962
Do you think she still thinks about me?

271
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:11,230
Probably.

272
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,020
Are there any questions?

273
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,800
Why would you tell me you miscarried our
child when you clearly didn't?

274
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:34,720
That's probably a question I should
answer more face-to-face

275
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:38,630
after the lecture, are there...
any... other... questions?

276
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:40,611
Yes, you sir.

277
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,048
Yeah, uhm... I think you should
answer his question.

278
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,075
<i>How did he get over ther so fast?</i>

279
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,901
- You're a good friend!
- I've got your back.

280
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,456
Anyone else have a question? Yes,
you... i-in the back.

281
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,071
Bust-a-move!

282
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,075
Really more of a statement than
a question, but thank you.

283
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,405
I've always wanted to be married so badly,

284
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,583
but what if I am settling with Keith?

285
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,781
Elliott, what you're going through is normal.

286
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:13,570
Hmm hmm, when I got engaged
all I could think of was...

287
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:17,110
"Why am I with this angry, cinical idiot?"

288
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,222
But then I fought through it and
realized he was the love of my life.

289
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:24,485
Unfortunately we had a little argument,
and so we broke up,

290
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:27,872
but then late I met Perry a month
later, we have 2 beautiful children

291
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:31,188
and the point is: sometimes settling works.

292
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:32,587
Oh.

293
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,328
And that is how I got my name.

294
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:37,812
You don't look Asian.

295
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:41,126
Hey, why aren't you being the
chief of medicine?

296
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,850
I'm just taking a break, Ted, I
don't want it to get stale.

297
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,272
The hospital needs you! I need you!
Doesn't that mean anything?

298
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:51,191
Damn right it does.

299
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,464
Now let's go find a cure for polio.

300
00:15:58,798 --> 00:15:59,578
Sorry...

301
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,503
Ah... ok, too soon for laughter,

302
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,526
I know that you must be really upset.

303
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,225
Upset is just one of the emotions I'm
feeling, Kim. How could you do this to me?

304
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,718
I don't know. My hormons went crazy!

305
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:17,181
And I was scared and I thought that we were
only together because I was pregnant.

306
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,651
and so, I lied and I pushed you out the door

307
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:22,365
and then I got really angry that you left me.

308
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,861
Were you ever planning on telling me?

309
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,213
Yes, of course. Yes. I just
hadn't figured out how yet.

310
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,383
I mean, what can I possibly say?

311
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:35,439
I don't know. How about: "JD, I think there
might be something living in my uterus".

312
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,336
I know I made a huge mistake.

313
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,365
And I'm so so sorry.

314
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,679
I did just hide back myself under this corner
and I didn't know how to get out and...

315
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:47,843
You know what?

316
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,073
No more excuses.

317
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,463
I did a horrible thing.

318
00:16:58,614 --> 00:17:00,116
I don't expect you to forgive me.

319
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,961
Ok, because I'm not going to.

320
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,999
You probably hate me right now
because I hate myself...

321
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,591
But it was really good seeing you and...

322
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,820
and I thought I can do this on my own,

323
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,276
but I can't.

324
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,783
I'm alone and I'm terrified,

325
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,806
and I have no right to ask you for this,

326
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,868
but I could really use some help.

327
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:36,173
Crap salad, I gotta go give another lecture.

328
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,774
I just need forty minutes and...

329
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:45,083
please stay. Promise me that you'll
just stay, and we can talk about this.

330
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:46,802
Fine.

331
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,158
But I'm not doing it for you.

332
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:50,820
Fair enough.

333
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:01,919
There's no need to freak out, Elliot. All women
go through the same stages once they are engaged.

334
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,364
First there's the: "Yeah, I'm engaged" stage.
Do you remember yesterday?

335
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,717
I know. It was so great.

336
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:13,048
Then comes the: "Oh, my God I can't believe
I'm gonna have sex with the same person

337
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,458
for the rest of my life" stage, and that's
when you head to the nearest frat house,

338
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,669
ditch your undies and then the next morning
do the walk of shame to your beemer.

339
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:22,406
Sure.

340
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:24,237
Elliot,

341
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:28,781
You'll get throgh this. You just have
to try to not act like a crazy person, see.

342
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,644
At times like this we tend to torture a man.

343
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:32,865
To test him.

344
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:35,701
Oh, yeah. I can't see myself doing that.

345
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:38,265
What's this, Keith? Huh?

346
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,054
Our sample invite
with the letter you picked up.

347
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:44,670
Uh, no. This is not, what I picked up.
I picked up Flourished Italic,

348
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,599
now you go back to the printer,
and tell them it should look like this.

349
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,816
I went to calligraphy camp. Now don't you screw
this up Keith.  Because if this goes wrong,

350
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,389
then the wedding goes wrong,
and then I'll get depressed, and fat,

351
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,476
and you cheat on me and I swear to God

352
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,025
I will CHOP IT OFF!

353
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:07,416
What just happened?

354
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,842
I suppose this will
dissolve surgical glue but...

355
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,096
may I ask how that happened in the first place?

356
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,100
Oh, you know, boys being boys.

357
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,547
A spect camera, eh?

358
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:23,876
My hospital Sacred Heart
needs one of those.

359
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:26,044
It's funny you should say that.

360
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:28,983
I was just on the phone with
your chief of medicine ten minutes ago.

361
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,044
Hm. Tax this to someone.

362
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,265
Chief o'medicine.

363
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:44,589
I'm the Chief of medicine, Bob Kelso.
Who the hell is this?

364
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,693
Uh, I'm you.

365
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,548
I'm talking to you from a future phone.

366
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,622
By the way sell all your gasoline stocks,

367
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,745
everything now runs on potatoes!

368
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,168
I don't know who the hell
this is but when I find out

369
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,666
I am going to put my lowfer so far up your ass

370
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,826
you're gonna have testicles hanging out of your nose.

371
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:01,972
Now, tell me who you are.

372
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,797
- What's your name again?
- Teddy Buckland.

373
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:06,281
Ted?

374
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,054
Naaah, he's never gonna believe I did this.

375
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,768
Hey, where'd you go?

376
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:27,877
I'm sorry sir, we don't have appletinis.
But I could make you a peachtini.

377
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,539
That's a little foofy
for my taste. A beer is fine.

378
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,200
With a pineapple wedge, please.

379
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:36,534
How you doing?

380
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,816
Not too bad, considering
I just had a bomb dropped on me.

381
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,210
No no, that was bigger than a bomb.

382
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,648
More like an asteroid about to hit the planet.

383
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:48,976
You know, people running
in the streets screaming,

384
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:50,695
<i>"Oh my god, it's coming right at us!"</i>

385
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,746
And then dudes turning
to hot chicks and they're all like, "Look,

386
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,934
we're about to die, so can I hit that?"

387
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,136
and then girl's like "Hell, to the no!"
but then she realizes,

388
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:01,248
"Oh my god, I'm about to die,

389
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,942
so you know what , yeah,
you can hit this, but no kissing."

390
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,862
That's exactly what it's like!

391
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,571
Thank you.

392
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,529
I'm just so mad I litterally
don't know what to say to her.

393
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:13,369
Don't you dare!

394
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,332
Part of me wants to talk to her,
part of me wants to...

395
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:17,894
Bust a move?

396
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:20,487
You have a problem, sir! Seek help!

397
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,492
- You know what you're gonna do?
- What?

398
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,125
You're gonna sit here and wait for Kim,

399
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,379
and then you're gonna talk to her,
because you're a good person.

400
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:31,919
No matter what mistakes she's made
she's still having your kid,

401
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,365
and you're not walking away from that.

402
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:43,314
Oh, say, Barbie, I'm gonna go ahead next here
one more time. May I please, please

403
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:45,737
use your practice's spect camera?

404
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:48,009
Sure, whatever.

405
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,873
That's great. Cause I've actually already used it.

406
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,675
I don't care.

407
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:56,666
And don't worry about coming to my wedding,
because it probably won't be one.

408
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:58,853
Look,

409
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,328
I love it that after six years
I can still mess with your head.

410
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,663
It is both a testament to my commitment

411
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:08,081
and a glaring statement about
your mental fragility.  But still is

412
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,797
as much as it pains me to say it,

413
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:14,178
there's nothing I did or said

414
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,961
that had any real impact on your
relationship with the future Mr. Barbie.

415
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:20,975
Yeah, well, I got all crazy
and went off on him.

416
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,787
Of course you did, you're a woman.

417
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,177
Sure, ya do come with a little extra crazy,

418
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:30,173
but what the heck, that's what makes you... you.

419
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:32,689
Listen to me,

420
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,121
Keith isn't going to care, he's not.

421
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,599
Why are you being so nice to me?

422
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,539
Lay off the stick or
I'll wait till you're asleep

423
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,042
and I will cheesegrate your nerps.

424
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,093
Because sometimes I like to do nice
things without being coerced.

425
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,084
- Oh...
- Hopefully that's the right lettering.

426
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:05,262
You're fine.

427
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:08,990
Now, if... if you go ahead and excuse me...

428
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,173
I'm gonna go and grab a quick
shower to get this moment offa me.

429
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:19,863
<i>Turk was giving me the silent treatment</i>

430
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:22,615
because I had taken
Old MC's advice over his.

431
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,682
<i>I had busted a move, and left.</i>

432
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:31,554
Oh, no. I'm saving this for someone.
He's should be here in a minute.

433
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:35,329
<i>And yeah, I still have doubts about my decision.</i>

434
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:44,287
I love you babe.

435
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,634
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

436
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,123
<i>I guess I'm just hoping
that the doubts will fade away.</i>

437
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:03,555
<i>Who am I kidding, eventually
we all have to face the music.</i>

438
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,315
-  You wanted to see me, sir?
- I know it was you,

439
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:08,897
and you are going to pay dearly.

440
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,724
Wait, first of all you need a new doctor.

441
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,663
Ta, ta, ta.

442
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:19,733
Dr. Toilet? He's beautiful.

443
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,597
I trimmed a little fat in the budget
so we could afford him.

444
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:25,386
- Ted's vacation pay?
- What vacation pay?

445
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:28,926
- Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha, ha. Get out of here.

446
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:29,668
Yeah.

447
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,377
<i>For now I was just glad to get back home
where life wasn't so complicated.  </i>

448
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:40,296
JD, do you think I'm making
a mistake by marrying Keith?

449
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,208
- Uh...
- JD?

450
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,977
How could you just leave me waiting there?

451
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,292
<i>Yep. Life is so much simpler here.</i>
