00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,812

the only one who loved breast feeding.</i>

00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,359
Ohhh, are you hungry, sweetie?

7
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:17,840
I could eat.

8
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:24,458
<i>Dr. Kelso discovered change was not always welcome.</i>

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,801
A coffee place in a hospital?

10
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,605
What's next, Bob, an ice cream parlor in the morgue?

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,200
Admittedly not a horrible idea, seeing as
the freezers are already down there,

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,100
plus it'll be a perfect place for kids

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,533

definitely takes the sting out of

having to identify the freshly charred
remains of your father!

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,800

16
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:49,764

18
00:00:58,686 --> 00:00:59,445
Ah! Another one!

19
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,514
Now I'm at the end of both lines.

20
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>Still, the best discovery
was learning that</i>

00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,875

That's what we call "Cabbage-tastic."

27

I scalded her pretty bad with some steamed milk,
you could see the bone.

Eww. How about a second of that dynamite ape impression.

So sorry.

37
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,663
Relax, it's just sex. We should be able to talk about it.

38
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,798
I'm not telling Isabella she's got a vagina till she turns eighteen.

That's gonna be an awkward birthday party.

40
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:19,730
Do not tell my daughter she has a vagina! I'm serious! 

41

It may have already come up.

42

Kim, uh, J.D. tells us that you're looking around town for a new job?

43
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:29,042
Yeah, I just don't think the department head here is ever gonna promote me.

44
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:29,513

 hot water through beans?

a complimentary reach-around with my beverage,

I'm afraid the answer is yeah...no!

Here's a--here's a novel idea:

58
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:22,850
Why don't you go fetch me a very large cup of coffee 

59
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,053
with so damn many fake sugars in it, that the coffee itself gets cancer.

"...someone need to switch to decaf?"

Lay off of Elliot. She doesn't watch as much old TV as we do.

64
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:43,008
You actually stood up for me! But, now I'm forced to ask--

65
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,769
"...who are you? And what have you done with Turk?"

168

There! See? You're already trying to treat yourself! 

169
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,280
That was a test.

170
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:31,655
But twenty-five grams would kill me.

171
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,721
I know. But i-i-it's still a test.

00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:39,529
Fine. From now on, you're the doctor.

173
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,102
All right, relax, you're fine. Just ice it when you get home. 

174
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,586
Put that away, Turk! That's back-alley money!

175
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:53,459
Relax!

176
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,873
Hey. I'll give you twenty bucks if you check out my rash.

177
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:00,842
'm sorry, cotton candy man, but unlike my friend, 

178
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,747
here, I have no interest in being sued for...

179
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:04,578
 Do I smell blue?

180
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,058
just added the dye.

181
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:11,249
Ohhhhh! You crafty, crafty man -- that is fluffing up nicely.

182
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,579
Hey, give me some money, I'm jonesing for some c-squared.

183
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,482
Oh, you don't want my back-alley money, do you?

184
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:19,041
You heartless bastard. 

185
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,498
All right, let's see your disgusting rash. 

186
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,810
It's probably just eczema.
 One blue, please!

187
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,999
I'd like to see the blueberry again.

188
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,614
Blueberries taste fresh.

189
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:47,353
Hint of lemon zest...I'm intrigued.

190
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,375
And unfortunately processed flour. No thank you.


191
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,247
Let me try your carrot.

192
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,374
I've a non-fat latte with room for Schnapps for Janitor?

193
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,512
Yep, thank you. 

194
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:06,977
Nice braces.

195
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:12,488
- You're not worried about, uh, spider monkeys?
- Spider monkeys?

196
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,841
Spider monkeys see intricate metal work 
as a display of dominance.

197
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,226
It's a threat to them -- they'd tear your eyes out.

198
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,809
Well, I'm just psyched this place is paying for 'em.

199
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,289
You get dental?

200
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,009
So, uh, Dr. Turner said that I am a very talented young physician.

201
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:35,898
Jordan said I'm the only man she ever wants to have sex with!

202
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:39,210
Aren't we sharing fantastic lies 

203
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,881
we choose to believe for personal reasons?

204
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:43,242
He's actually a very deferential patient.

205
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,914
 Instead of surgery, I'm treating his AAA with drugs.

206
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,032
Dr. Chatterbox there scheduled him for...surgery.

207
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:52,689
What the hell, Kersh!

208
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,679
I don't care if we had extra coffee money left over...

209
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,559
I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,295
Dude, stop stressing. See you later.

211
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,648
Is anybody planning on emptying that?

212
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,441
<i>Sometimes everything you need to know is on the side of a coffee cup.
</i>

213
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:16,856
<i>Never underestimate those around you...</i>

214
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,546
<i>or they may betray you...</i>

215
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,016
Greetings, customer! What can I get you?

216
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:26,930
<i>...they may deceive you...</i>

217
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,027
And here we are. 

218
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,080
Even though Kershnar's signature is on the chart, 

219
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,561
this is the gentleman who ordered the surgery.

220
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:36,983
No, he didn't. Tell him.

221
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,441
What would you like me to say?

222
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm just gonna go ahead and tip myself for calling this one! 

223
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,442
Thank you, 

224
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,722
me!

225
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:52,290
<i>in the end, those same people 
will make you wish you'd never met them.</i>

226
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,697
<i>Maybe that wasn't just a rash on cotton candy man.</i>

227
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,723
<i>I didn't tell Kim about how I most likely ruined my career</i>

228
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,954
<i> by misdiagnosing the cotton candy man.</i>

229
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,731
<i> I don't like to be a burden to the people I care about.</i>

230
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,838
Turk. I need you, and I need you now.

231
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:18,999
Isabella, this is the man you'll be competing with 
for your father's love.

232
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,376
Goochie-goochie-goo. Turk. Now.

233
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,375
Babe, he's using his emergency tone.

234
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,415
Go ahead. I have to feed her anyway.

235
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:32,383
Ugh, my breasts are so sore. 
I wish I could just give you formula.

236
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,079
Formula's bad for the baby. 

237
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,765
Boob milk's healthier!

238
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,716
His rash is probably purpura from 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy,

239
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,091
 and I missed it, Turk. I'm screwed! 

240
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,307
Okay, you...you go in there and take care of things.

241
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,310
I'll...I'll just stand out here and think about 
all the things I'll miss about being a doctor.

242
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,215
The light cotton outfits...

243
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,790
the free gauze....

244
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:02,798
He's gone. 

245
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,934
Somebody shot him.

246
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,292
I hope it wasn't the corn-dog guy.

247
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:11,389
They never got along.

248
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:18,034
Look, Dr. Turner, you're older, you're not in the best health.

249
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,628
I really think that this surgery could kill you.

250
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,618
Are they gonna come in and shave me soon?

251
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,731
I'm still your primary physician.

252
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,953
No, Kershnar's my lead now.

253
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,322
I think surgery is the right choice.

254
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,106
Did you give him cue cards?

255
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,939
That way he gets it exactly right.



256
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,881
You don't scare me. Eventually, you will all come crawling back.

257
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,054
 Now, how about somebody gets me a 
banana-nut muffin, and hold the spit, please.

258
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,294
As manager, I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.

259
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,743
Manager? You have worked here one day.

260
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:57,322
Corporate loved my ingenuity. 

261
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,298
I was saying, the two most addictive substances on earth

262
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:05,334
 are caffeine and...nicotine! Behold. 

263
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,421
Smokachino! For Kyle. 

264
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:14,582
Kyle! Smokachino for Kyle!

265
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,575
 Enjoy that. 

266
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,480
That's as tall as he's gonna get.

267
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,374
I feel like I dodged a bullet.

268
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,729
 Trust me, Brown Bear, you don't want this 
hanging over your head.

269
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,803
 Find Vijay and give him his twenty bucks back.

270
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,859
Yeah, but then I'd have to give the money back to all the others. 

271
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,228
I kinda did a few diagnoses at the mall yesterday.

272
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,448
Are you crazy? You could get sued!

273
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,732
Secondly, I can't believe you went to the mall without me...

274
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,698
I specifically told you I needed to buy loafers. 

275
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,049
And thirdly, how could you go to the mall without me? 
That's our thing!

276
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,835
Well, I don't see you giving the money back 
to cotton candy man!

277
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,699
As a matter of fact, I already did.

278
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,367
A twenty! Score! 

279
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,444
 ...Cool shirt...!

280
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,684
All right, I earned that money, and I'm not giving it back, 

281
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,508
and there's nothing you can do to make me.

282
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,124
Give those people their money back!

283
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:09,863
- I can't believe you told!
- Turk, we're doctors. We live by a moral code.

284
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,870
Aloha! I came to see the little kahuna!



285
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:20,600
- Giant coffee.
- Saw you coming. Here's your vente drip. 

286
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,776
How 'bout a Corinne Bailey Ray CD. 

287
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,898
With her stripped-down sound and chilled-out vibe,

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 this British soul superstar is one of the year's hottest newcomers.

289
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,852
You know what...I'll take one of those.

290
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,698
It's a sale.

291
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,595
You know the worst thing about Turner's surgery?

292
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:43,584
I'm gonna be right, but...he's gonna die. 
It'll be a hollow victory.

293
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:47,138
If I got to be right and have a private practice doctor 

294
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:51,926
die due to his own idiocy,
 I would call that a pretty full victory.

295
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,190
Banana-nut muffin, please.

296
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,334
Sir, I've been told not to serve you.

297
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,034
Hey, just take me. 

298
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,574
What are they gonna do, put you in jail? 

299
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,467
You're Bob Kelso! 

300
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,556
Just grab me and run! 

301
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,437
Do it! 

302
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,401
All right, I'm going on break.
 Don't touch the muffin puppet.

303
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,783
Let's see if you're qualified to hold your own baby.

304
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,478
I caught it! That counts! 

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,711
I'm gonna go hold the crap outta that baby!

306
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,515
J.D., what the hell!

307
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,084
 I'm a surgeon...that coulda hit my hand!

308
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,013
Why are you being so weird lately?

309
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,845
You won't loan me money for cotton candy, 
you're charging strangers for medical advice,

310
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,341
 and now you're worried about your hand?

311
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,476
 Who are you?

312
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,749
...and what did you do with Turk?

313
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:02,384
Great work, everybody! Thank you! 

314
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,082
I asked them to help me out for emphasis.


315
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,522
Seriously, what's going on?

316
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,225
You saw what happened yesterday.

317
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,664
Ohhh, look at this little angel.

318
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,992
 I may never go back to work.

319
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:20,743
How the hell am I supposed to take care 
of a whole family by myself?

320
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,223
I'm so sorry, Barbie.

321
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,448
Why didn't he listen?

322
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,317
I thought that you hated him.

323
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,685
Ah, when it comes to torturing you, 
everybody's on the same page.

324
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:40,757
You know, Reid, 

325
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,477
you had the cojones to stand up to me, 

326
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,643
unlike Kershnar,  whom I've so demoralized

327
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:50,169
 he's basically my trained chimp. 

328
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,642
He's almost human.

329
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,103
Anyway, I've got enough yes-men. 

330
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:04,063
You've got a spine. Join my practice.

331
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,040
 You can still work out of this hospital,

332
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,303
 the only difference is you'd make double the money.

333
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:14,966
Easy, buddy. That smell burning your nostrils isn't 
just the baby throw-up on her jacket

334
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:17,065
Oh, uh, I got to hold Isabella. 

335
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,894
She squirted out of my arms, but Carla caught her.

336
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,756
It's the smell of a doctor with integrity.

337
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:26,333
Also, you'll never have to answer to this guy again.

338
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,549
- Wow, I got a family.
-  I know.

339
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,036
 In seven months, I'm gonna have a family, too. 

340
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:47,003
Did you ever think we'd be here back 
when we were freshmen in college?

341
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:49,804
Remember that first week 

342
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,509
when I found you hooking up with my girlfriend, and you said 

343
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:55,999
you guys were only naked underneath the covers
 because you'd had a water-balloon fight 

344
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,000
and you were cold?

345
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,060
J.D., for the last time, nothing happened.

346
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,012
Please, this isn't about that. 

347
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,741
It's just that I looked all over, I never found any balloons.

348
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,332
 You'd think there'd be some balloons.

349
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,885
I look at Isabella, and I get really scared.

350
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,670
 And I'm gonna need you to be there to help me through this.

351
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,183
Well that sucks, 'cause I was counting on you 

352
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:20,021
to make it look easy so I know I can handle it when my turn comes.

353
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:21,648
Awesome.

354
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,611
Turk, you're at the beginning of your career.

355
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,094
 You know you're gonna make plenty of money.

356
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,836
It's good to hear that from you, thank you.

357
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,090
- You're gonna be just fine.
- I suppose so.

358
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,621
- ..Totally fine.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,056
Would you mind telling me
that I'm gonna be fine, Turk?

360
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,814
Am I gonna be fine?
 I think I'm gonna be fine!

361
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,244
Well, I would, but I don't know how much you like Kim.

362
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,683
I really like her.

363
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,980
Then you're gonna be fine.

364
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,179
Thanks.


365
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,897
Is there anything else you wanna...tell me, or admit to?


366
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,184
I mean, I looked everywhere, there was...no signs of balloons.

367
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,739
<i>Opportunities are everywhere...</i>

368
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,239
<i>...Whether it's accepting an old job...</i>

369
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,844
You can have your dental.

370
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,709
Now clean up this mess.

371
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,076
<i>..or taking a new job.</i>

372
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,845
I'd...like to join your practice.

373
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>As for me, I was just excited
to have the opportunity</i>

374
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,546
to get to know the
mother of my child better.

375
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,698
I got offered a new job.

376
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:47,772
Cool! Is it over at County?

377
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,536
'Cause that way I can drop you off every morning.

378
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,425
It's in Tacoma, Washington.

379
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,236
That's gonna be a little rough on my scooter.
