1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,552
Welcome home, Perry.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,231
Here's the new program :

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,574
You occasionally lift a finger helping with Jack

4
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:14,572
and I'm gonna try to keep from hating the unborn baby in my belly

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,577
that's made my ass so big, I can't fit the whole thing on a toilet

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,329
when I pee eight hundred times a day ! I can't.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,434
You love spaghetti.

8
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,252
You had some just last night, didn't ya ?

9
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:25,651
No, I didn't !

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,581
Jordan, the boy is lying to me.

11
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,539
Oh, Perry, nobody likes a tattle-tail !

12
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,497
Nobody does, Perry!

13
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:37,641
All right, champ.
Just in case you get hungry later on....

14
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,274
Yo ! Elliot.

15
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:44,756
what's your ringtone ?

16
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,162
"Jesus Takes The Wheel" by Carrie Underwood.

17
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:50,710
I'm carrying underwood right now.
See, that's funny because it's true.

18
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:53,540
Please ?

19
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:56,477
But that's all you get for the rest of the year, Todd.

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,553
I'm downloading 'N Sync's "Bye Bye Bye."

21
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:00,840
When that bad boy starts a-jumpin

22
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,138
I defy anyone not to shake their butt to it.

23
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:04,393
I'm bringing it back.

24
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,715
Just like you brought back Pop-Rocks ?

25
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:08,002
Teddy boy !

26
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,981
Yeah, well,
you're not as big a trend-setter as you think you are.

27
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,092
Right, Keith ?

28
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:19,880
As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,568
I just met pregnant.

30
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:22,296
You're pregnant ?

31
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,254
Are you sure ?

32
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,031
I'm pretty sure.

33
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:31,443
Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this,

34
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,569
so I'm just gonna dive right in :

35
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,444
Have there been other penises ?

36
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:36,646
It's yours, J.D.

37
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:37,598
Cool.

38
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:38,381
Are you okay ?

39
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:41,542
Yeah.

40
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:44,523
I don't think I've ever seen
the inside of your apartment before.

41
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,136
Said the father of my unborn child. Heh !

42
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:48,891
That was a joke.

43
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:50,353
Oh, come on.

44
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,333
No laugh from a guy who,
when he orders a coffee, says "Thanks a latte !"

45
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,479
Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious.

46
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:57,933
This is life-changing.

47
00:01:57,934 --> 00:01:58,857
We can get through this.

48
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,931
You know what else is pretty classic,
when the coffee guy asks for money,

49
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,843
you say : "Sorry,
my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos."

50
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,298
That always gets 'em.

51
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,032
Ah, dammit.

52
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:11,277
I have to go to the hospital.

53
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,767
Scone is also a--a funny word,

54
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,893
but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.

55
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,290
You're clearly freaking out,

56
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,842
so, um, you need to
promise me that you're gonna

57
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,394
find somebody to talk to
about this while I'm gone.

58
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,511
Please! I'll be fine.
You be careful

59
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,145
you're walking for two !

60
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:27,194
Call Turk.

61
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,072
You were right, Turk.

62
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,432
Hell, yeah !

63
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,726
All right ! All right ! Now listen !

64
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:43,670
This is a hospital, not a discotheque !

65
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,544
Turn that damn thing off !

66
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:47,334
Come on, buddy. Please pick up.

67
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,020
This is pretty catchy.

68
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,328
No problem.

69
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:03,586
I'll just go chill at my deck

70
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,706
with a little vino.

71
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:09,209
Unfortunately,

72
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,867
it was still a hangout spot for gay seniors.

73
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,699
All right ! That's enough !

74
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,055
I have seen "Les Mis" over a dozen times,

75
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:23,140
so I have nothing against giant queens per se,
all right ?

76
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:27,895
In fact, my life would be a whole lot easier
if I was married to one of you guys.... Excuse me.

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,343
You heard him, girls ?

78
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:33,546
Let's roll !

79
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,192
Hold up ! Hold up ! Hold up !

80
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:48,486
"Las Vegas Police Department."

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,472
Hello ?

82
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,423
Why didn't you answer your phone when I called you ?

83
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,654
I was dancing.

84
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,087
Ohhhh. Wait, let me hear it.

85
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:05,865
- Ao -

86
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:06,965

Par la High-Five Team(+fouf.83)

93
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,571
Well, look, I'm in surgery all morning,

94
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,844
but we can meet for lunch,
talk this through then, okay ?

95
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,074
Hello ?

96
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,977
J.D., this is a really bad connection

97
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,242
Ted, please !

98
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:33,131
Ted !

99
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,327
Okay, I'll see you at lunch.

100
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:39,593
Hey, mojambo

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,131
This here's our new flagpole.

102
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,012
Why don't you show Old Glory
a little respect and snap off a salute ?

103
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,292
There's no flag up there.

104
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,691
We're at war, my friend.

105
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,089
All American flags are on backorder.

106
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,708
What do you want me to do in the meantime,

107
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,418
run a pirate flag up there ?

108
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,779
Maybe turn the whole building into a pirate ship ?

109
00:05:58,055 --> 00:05:59,537
I could put a captain's wheel up on the roof...

110
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:02,495
catch a parrot somehow...slap on an eyepatch...

111
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:05,706
go to work with a caulk-gun,
seal her up, make her watertight

112
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,510
I can take her out to sea.

113
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,344
-Are you insane ?
-Nah. I'm a pirate.

114
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:13,328
Whatever.
I'm--I--I--I'm not saluting a pole !

115
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,916
And so it begins...again.

116
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,237
My life is over.

117
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,642
Oh, come on, you gotta focus on the positives.

118
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,881
For instance, the medical miracle that is

119
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,370
one woman actually impregnating another woman.

120
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,657
Shadaisy !

121
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,972
Coincidentally,
I have a cousin named Shadaisy !

122
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,007
What ?

123
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:36,321
J.D. needs us right now, okay ?

124
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,864
So this is what we're gonna do:
Dr. Cox, you're backing off.

125
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,601
Elliot, you go talk to him.

126
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,861
Can't wait to talk to J.D.

127
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:44,126
Maybe we can chat about how everyone in this frickin' hospital,

128
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,609
other than me, is having a baby.

129
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,282
I mean, seriously, having a baby,
having a baby,

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,322
having a second baby ! Or having her
husband's best friend's baby !

131
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,071
That's right, Mona, everyone knows !

132
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,290
What are you looking at,
Dr Beardface ? You want a kid ?

133
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:58,644
Cause I swear to God,
I will mount you right now !

134
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,630
It's Beardfacé, dammit !

135
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,406
Gather round,

136
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,365
doomed new interns who just paged me !

137
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:07,987
Quick question :

138
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:10,630
What does this outfit tell you ?

139
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,058
You...are entering
a Joe Piscopo look-alike contest ?

140
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:17,609
It means that I was just working out

141
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,894
which, incidentally, is the last
remaining activity I have in my adult life

142
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,443
that qualifies as "me time."
Other activities recently crossed off of that list

143
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,560
include my morning dump and all showers.

144
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:31,344
You see, my dear son Jack
has decided that those are team sports.

145
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:33,998
However, I'm here, and I'm
totally psyched to hear whatever

146
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,651
the super-de-duper reason
is that you paged me.

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,828
Mr. White's chart said to remove his eight stitches,

148
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:41,919
but we counted nine.

149
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:43,741
Should we leave one ?

150
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,968
That's it.

151
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:46,925
Every single one of you

152
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,779
is gonna run laps around the hallways until I say stop.

153
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:51,999
Think I'm kidding ?

154
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,481
Perry ? What the hell ?
I just got a call from Jack's school.

155
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,825
Apparently they served spaghetti for lunch,
so he had some sort of Vietnam flashback.

156
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,610
We're having a second baby.
You need to deal with your anger issues.

157
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:11,179
I don't have any anger issues.

158
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,997
Dr. Cox, I'm sorry,

159
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,130
but my asthma...is really...starting...to...

160
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:19,095
GET OUTTA HERE !

161
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,689
Seriously?

162
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,291
What are you working on, young man ?

163
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,641
New ways to torture that guy. See ?

164
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,690
Mrs. Zeebee,

165
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:40,992
I know that we were hoping that the pain
around your areola was simple mastitis,

166
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,823
but it turns out that it's breast cancer.

167
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,131
I can't believe this is happening to me.

168
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:52,966
Trust me, I know what you're going through.
Just yesterday, I found out that my girlfriend...

169
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:54,033
'Scuse us !

170
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,646
Dude, please tell me you're not comparing
getting cancer to knocking up your girlfriend.

171
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:58,901
I was trying to !

172
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:01,463
You can't pawn your personal stuff off on your patients !

173
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,488
What about you and the motorcycle accident guy ?

174
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:08,308
So get this: My pregnant wife has decided
that it's okay to steal my pillow

175
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,828
in the middle of the night and sleep
with it in between her legs !

176
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,082
When am I going in to surgery ?

177
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,188
Oh, we can't start the surgery
until the troopers find your foot.

178
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:20,499
That was different.
He said, "What's up ?"

179
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,642
Hardly seems like much of a punishment for the kid from Kenya.

180
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,643
I mean, God's sake, he could run all day.

181
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:29,943
You know, maybe Jordan's right

182
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,443
maybe it's time you start dealing with your anger issues ?

183
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:33,242
Carla,

184
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:36,028
for something to be an issue, it needs to cause a problem.

185
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,582
I mean, honestly, aside from having
to -- by law -- remain thirty feet away

186
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:45,927
from a certain telemarketer who I visited
while he was eating his dinner, I don't see the downside.

187
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,019
Mr. Slydell here is suffering from
peptic ulcer disease and hypertension

188
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:53,336
two conditions you'll often see in very angry people.

189
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:56,866
Now, now, you don't know that this gentleman is angry.

190
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,539
Damn it !

191
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:01,896
Why won't this TV go on ?

192
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,821
That was the bed remote.

193
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:07,121
Ted !

194
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,050
I...I got the cola.

195
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,860
-Did you get the Pop Rocks ?
-No, the vending machine was out,

196
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:14,060
so I went to the generic store
and got some "Fizzy Pebbles."

197
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,350
Sure we should do this ?

198
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:17,308
I'm sick of legends and hearsay, Keith !

199
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,309
I have to know !

200
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,309
No scuffing. No scuffing !

201
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,568
Okay, what if...

202
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:31,069
I get a sex-change operation,
and I trick him into marrying me ?

203
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,611
But if it doesn't work,
you'll just be an older,

204
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:36,666
fairly ugly, janitor woman.

205
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,209
That's true.

206
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,600
You know, you and I are quite a bit alike.

207
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,312
I spent most of my life trying to become a lawyer.

208
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,499
But I could never get my juris doctorate.

209
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,207
How does that make us alike ?

210
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,218
Ohh, I spent years trying

211
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:50,763
to get that damn J.D...
(Jurist Doctorate)

212
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:00,360
Hey! That'll be fun to clean up !

213
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,220
You know what's so messed up
about this whole baby thing ?

214
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,736
I mean, I feel like I'm drowning,

215
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,437
and it hasn't even fazed Kim.

216
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,556
Okay, let's, uh, close her up.

217
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,367
Dr. Briggs? Why are you crying ?

218
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:16,668
This song always gets me.

219
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,605
My brother was killed by a funky cold medina.

220
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:23,914
I'm sorry, J.D,

221
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,467
but you knew that this could happen
when you had sex.

222
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,187
I have to tell you guys something,
but you have to promise not to laugh, okay ?

223
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,822
- Oh, no, absolutely.
-I'll try.
-Right. Sure.

224
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,704
Okay, on the night of said conception,

225
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:35,969
uh, Kim and I nuded up,

226
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,942
and um...the dirty talk began,

227
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,392
and I got a little over-excited.

228
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,269
Ooooh! She like-a the dirty talk !

229
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,169
No, I do.

230
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,465
I find it gets the ladies going,
but I occasionally get wrapped up in it myself,

231
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:53,337
especially when I use some of my different voices....

232
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:54,236
He does.

233
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:58,623
Anyhoo, there was some unexpected friendly fire.

234
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:05,538
even though I never got a chance
to enter..."the village"

235
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:12,490
...there was a..."airstrike" on one of the outlying regions.

236
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:17,620
Anyway, I spoke to the gals up in OB-G,

237
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,621
and they said it's not uncommon for a woman to get pregnant

238
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:23,216
even if there was no actual penetration.

239
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,293
What you trying to tell us is that you...

240
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:29,202
never actually had sex with her ?

241
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:30,797
No, I didn't have a condom.

242
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,944
And, uh, we decided not to have sex because

243
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:37,510
...here's the kicker...

244
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,412
....I didn't want to get her pregnant.

245
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,894
As I thought about how Mrs. Zeebee and I

246
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,517
had gotten such a raw deal,

247
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,475
I realized how easy it was

248
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,546
for doctors to see themselves in their patients.

249
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,035
Whether it's in the choices they made in their life...

250
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,392
My anger not only cost me my health,

251
00:12:57,763 --> 00:12:59,329
it also cost me my job,

252
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,784
my marriage

253
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,553
...it cost me damn near everything.

254
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,623
You're killing me.

255
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,609
...or the choices they didn't make...

256
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,155
I was so obsessed with getting my J.D.

257
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,644
that I never did the things I really wanted to do,

258
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,071
start a family,

259
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:15,973
see the world....

260
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:17,457
Punch a whale ?

261
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:18,850
No, I punched a whale,

262
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,728
right in the face.

263
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,330
Down he went, like Liston.

264
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:27,723
Either way, it forces you to face your problems head-on.

265
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:29,009
There you are.

266
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,638
You ready to grab some lunch so that we can talk ?

267
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:32,686
Or not.

268
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,936
You know what, Kim, I don't think
I can handle this right now.

269
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,334
Oh, okay. Yeah. That's great. Um....

270
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:49,434
Heads up.

271
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:53,533
You seen J.D. ?

272
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:56,310
I have not.

273
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:57,709
Any idea where he is ?

274
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,709
Teaching CPR to underprivileged youth
at Lincoln Middle School on 18th Street.

275
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,247
I can't believe he got that !

276
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,948
We are so ready for that
charades tournament on Saturday !

277
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:12,448
Come on, Turk, where is he ?

278
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:17,290
You know, Kim, I'm sorry but I really have...no idea.

279
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,157
Traitor !

280
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:28,563
Space-wasters, why haven't any of you
placed a pulmonary artery cath on this guy ?

281
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,367
Hey, let's try to use our inside voice around the interns.

282
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,570
We don't want to scare them.

283
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,393
What kind of new crazy is this ?

284
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:39,235
Oh, Elliot snapped a little
and decided the interns were her babies.

285
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,480
Oops, Jakie.

286
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,964
Somebody's got a little smudgie on his face.
There you go.

287
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,375
Long as he gets done.

288
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:49,010
Um, why doesn't Elliot have
a freshly-ripped new one right now ?

289
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm not freshly ripping anybody anything anymore.

290
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:52,956
I am done with anger.

291
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:56,172
Oh, is that gonna be like the time you quit drinking ?

292
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,151
Cause that was the longest twenty minutes of my life !

293
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:01,411
Your sarcasm is wasted on me,
you giant pregnant beast.

294
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:06,319
This is an anger-free zone.
There's no anger here.

295
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:09,911
Counter!

296
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,446
I filled it with blue Gatorade.

297
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,775
-I just do that to freak people out.
-Scintillating.

298
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,919
Say, since we're small talking,
let me...let me ask you a question :

299
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:32,528
Do you have any...regrets
about the way you lived your life ?

300
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,718
Cause I think I do.

301
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,062
You've never been to Paris and cleaned a French toilet, huh ?

302
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,169
Oh! Haha, good one.
No, that's not it.

303
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,146
Come on, be straight with me.
Do you think I'm wasting my life ?

304
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,031
Let's cut to the chase, freak-show.

305
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:45,697
If you're a 44-year-old man wearing a jumpsuit

306
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,006
and you are not climbing into the cockpit of a rocket ship,

307
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,356
chances are you've made a lot of wrong turns along the way.

308
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,391
Good talk !

309
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:58,185
Dude, what the hell am I supposed to tell Kim
when she asks why I drove off like that ?

310
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,928
Tell her you hate white chicks.

311
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,413
And then when she says,
"No you don't," you say,

312
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,897
"I mean 'White Chicks' the movie --
not a fan of those Wayans brothers."

313
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,441
Then she'll laugh and forget why she was mad at you.

314
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,240
You're right! That'll work.

315
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:10,273
But still, you need to man up and talk to her.

316
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,146
You have no idea what I'm going through.

317
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,881
Really? Cause the last time I checked,

318
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:14,722
I was having a kid, too.

319
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,229
Yeah, that you planned with your wife,

320
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,889
whose middle name you know.

321
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,553
It's Juanita, Turk !

322
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,372
Carla's middle name is Juanita !

323
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,932
I knew it was something Puerto Rican.

324
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,771
What if Kim and I don't end up together ?
Okay ? I already have enough trouble meeting girls.

325
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,947
Can you imagine it now ? "Hey, how you doin' ? I'm J.D.,

326
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,231
and this little bugger right here already
hates ya for not being his real mommy !

327
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:36,377
Wanna get freaky ?
I'm apparently very fertile !

328
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:38,498
My life has changed forever !

329
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,815
You wanna be like everybody else and say
"Everything's gonna be just fine!" ?

330
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,015
Dude, I'm your best friend --
I'll tell you whatever you want me to.

331
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,436
Say, Barbie?
Have you seen any of the interns around ?

332
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,609
Yeah. They did so well at rounds,

333
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,205
I'm just letting them watch a show.

334
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,534
Oh. Hi, interns.

335
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,737
Hi.

336
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,634
Look, you pretty obviously have short-circuited.

337
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,437
Because the odds of you ever actually
having a baby are roughly on a par with me

338
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,944
finding the Loch Ness monster in my bathtub.

339
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,850
Shh! I can't hear the TV !

340
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,388
Hi, honey !

341
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,297
Hyah! Go on, get outta here !
Come on ! You too ! Get outta here ! Hyah !

342
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,157
Don't even say a word.

343
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,682
Mr. Slydell's ulcer perforated and he bled out.

344
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:33,717
He's dead.

345
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,445
Well, if it isn't my beautiful bride,
Carla Juanita Espinosa.

346
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:47,955
Juanita ?

347
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:50,585
You think my middle name is Juanita ?

348
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,046
I am going to kill J.D.  !

349
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:02,125
Uh, Dr. Dorian, look, uh,
this is a bit awkward, but, uh, as chief of medicine,

350
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:05,550
I feel obligated to ask you about
your relationship with Dr. Briggs....

351
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:08,543
Was she naughty ?

352
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,033
I bet she's a hellcat.

353
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,460
Get help, sir.

354
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:15,369
Never mind. It's, uh, better up here.

355
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,444
Mrs. Zeebee's CAT-scan came back.

356
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:21,803
Oh, man. This just sucks.

357
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,971
Mlle Zeebee,

358
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,719
unfortunately the cancer isn't localized just to your breast.

359
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,097
We're gonna have to start chemo right away.

360
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,820
The most important thing to remember
when you see yourself in a patient

361
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:37,467
is that they're not actually you.

362
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:58,783
In fact, sometimes, they're actually
who we wish we had the courage to be.

363
00:18:59,286 --> 00:18:59,930
You know what ?

364
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:01,944
I'm gonna get through this.

365
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,294
Just you watch.

366
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,216
Not like I can change what's already happened.
The only thing to do is move forward and deal with it.

367
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:11,095
Right ?

368
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,226
Yeah.

369
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,398
Right then, I knew exactly what I had to do,

370
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,499
come hell or high water.

371
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,630
Uh-huh ! I got your Juanita.

372
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:26,924
Juanita, huh ?

373
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:29,889
Well you can Jua-nita this right there.

374
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:35,931
What the hell ?

375
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:37,279
It's now or never.

376
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,771
Are you gonna let me down anytime soon ?

377
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,317
Not until you spend a little time acting like a flag.

378
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,557
As I acted like a flag, I sensed that the Janitor

379
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,044
learned nothing from this experience.

380
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,618
Dr. Cox, on the other hand, got halfway there.

381
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,856
He may always be angry at work,

382
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:15,205
but he had learned to control himself when it counts.

383
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,136
Jacky, would you like some hot dogs ?

384
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,150
I don't want hot dogs !

385
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,052
That's okay, 'cause we've got your favorite yogurt.

386
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,724
As for me, I finally came through,
even if it was a little late.

387
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:32,549
Can we talk ?

388
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:34,591
That'd be great.
