1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:04,004
<i>Everyone had gathered,
because today</i>

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,660
<i>was Carla's first day back
since she had the baby.</i>

3
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:10,154
She's coming! This is not a drill,
repeat. This is not a drill.

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,680
Remember, one group says
"Welcome", one group says "back",

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,037
one group says "Carla".
Ok, get ready, let's go!

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,075
Elliot?

7
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:22,641
Fine, it was a drill. But I
just want us to be ready.

8
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,204
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,288
Hey everyone!

10
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:26,606
Okay, let's have it.

11
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,770
Back, Carla, back!

12
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,042
Dammit, people!

13
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,373
- It's ok, baby.
- No, it's not ok!

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,104
One more time, go!

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:35,277
Hey, everyone.

16
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,825
Welcome Back, Carckle...

17
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:39,482
Who the hell came up with "pickle"?!

18
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,795
I did. If you call Carla pickle,

19
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,613
I can call Isabella "Little Gurken".
I need this.

20
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:46,700
Done.

21
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,687
Actually babe, I'm just
heading back home.

22
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:53,239
It turned out my maternity lead
doesn't end until next week.

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,054
Ooh, pickle, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,625
What is all this fuss about
nurse Turkleton returning?

25
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,425
She's only been gone six days.

26
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,768
She's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo.
But wait, before I make you look

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,275
like a complete idiot, we'd all like
to thank you for setting up the new

28
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,479
employee discount of
copydump.

29
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:11,150
Gang!

30
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:13,646
- Cheers!
- Pickle!

31
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:16,748
Stop, if it had taken any effort
I wouldn't have done it.

32
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,831
And I mean that.
I really do.

33
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,288
And back to insulting you,
she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo,

34
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:26,612
the 6 days that you're referring to are
the 6 days you actually worked this month.

35
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:31,593
<i>Dr. Cox was right. This year Dr. Kelso
had gotten a little lazy.</i>

36
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,500
<i>There was the way he
handled requests.</i>

37
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,986
Thanks. I'm working to it.

38
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,705
<i>Or how he found a way to eliminate
any facetime with the patients.</i>

39
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,172
<i>Welcome to Sacred Heart, Mr...</i>

40
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,491
Hartly.

41
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,230
<i>I'm Chief of Medicine,
dr. Bob Kelso.</i>

42
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,397
<i>I see you're here for a...</i>

43
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:53,573
Vasectomy.

44
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,653
<i>Enjoy your stay.</i>

45
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:59,037
<i>Ted, you have not to forget the tape.</i>

46
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,316
How does he always know?

47
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,161
<i>He didn't even bothered to
learn the new interns' names.</i>

48
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,611
Listen up, faces. In order to
save us all some time,

49
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:13,698
I will call all the males "Daves"
and all the females "Debbies".

50
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:15,613
Debbie is actually my name.

51
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:19,366
Then our reference is to the others,
you will be Slugathor.

52
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:23,003
Daves, Debbies, Slugathor...
I will be in my office.

53
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,776
If you need anything, feel
free to bother Dorian.

54
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:29,162
<i>I always wondered what he
did in his office all day.</i>

55
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:35,999
Human Magic 8 Ball, tell me
if I should play golf this weekend.

56
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:45,101
- I'm a lawyer!
- I said, should I play golf?

57
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,522
Ask again later.

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,856
Why would I say that?

59
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,773
My daydreams are crazy.

60
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,453
Oooh...dizzy.

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,450
<i>Since Elliot bought a house,
I had to look for a place to live.</i>

68
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,038
<i>Time to get out of my
head and into an apartment.</i>

69
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,342
Hey, Dr.Kelso.

70
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,961
<i>I actually don't mind
that goofy bastard,</i>

71
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,226
<i>if he were gay he would
be perfect for my son.</i>

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,727
<i>Harrison's been looking
for a new power bottom.</i>

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,993
<i>All my little worker bees,
buzzing buzz...buzz...buzz...</i>

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,634
<i>I love making that sound.
Buzz...</i>

75
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:43,456
<i>Dr. Reid.</i>

76
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:47,785
<i>Ever since she quit the hospital for private
practice, you've pretended she's invisible.</i>

77
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,548
<i>So don't break, strike!</i>

78
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:51,830
Hey!

<i>Skittle-a-dee, skittle-a-doo!</i>

80
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,171
Dr. Kelso.

<i>What if this isnt',
Nurse Buzzkiller.</i>

82
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:00,519
- Good morning, nurse Roberts.
- Carla's gone, another week.

83
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,379
We need a substitute Head Nurse.

84
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:06,862
Laverne, from now on if you need
something just take care of it yourself.

85
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:08,537
In fact, all of you
should hear this.

86
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,132
I believe that it was Robin Zender, of "Chip
Trick", who said "I want you to want me",

87
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,865
well if I sang that song it would go
"I don't want you to want me".

88
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,472
<i>Skittle-a-dee, skittle-a-doo!</i>

<i>Time to visit my one

00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:29,220
<i>and then it's off ot the office and
a loo lappy damper.</i>

91
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:34,941
<i>Brian Dancer has high dull suffer, so
ok, turn on the down-home, crapulon.</i>

92
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:39,128
Hey there, young. Hella.
Holla. Bob Kelso here.

93
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:43,492
I understand that since you're headwound,
you have some short term memory loss.

94
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:45,129
Headwound?

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,435
No, I'm just kidding, Doctor.

96
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,008
Ah, see, now I'm embarrassed
because that wound's real.

97
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,931
That doesn't matter, son.

98
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,995
<i>Bob Kelso, write it
down, dammit!</i>

99
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:01,390
So, I see you're in the Service.

100
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,575
Yessir, Private Brian Dancer.

101
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,777
Private Dancer? Tough name.
Must had your share of big dance.

102
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,478
- How d'you hurt your noggin?
- An I.E.D. got our transport vehicle,

103
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,335
I accidentally left a couple of chunks
of my skull in Baghdad.

104
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:21,764
<i>Iraq! You know how controversial that
topic is, Bob, quick, change the subject.</i>

105
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:25,365
So, Pluto's not a planet anymore,
what's up with that?

106
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:30,900
<i>Well played, Bobby. Lord knows you've
seen this hot bottom topics before.</i>

107
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,851
Oh, please Laverne.
Global warming?

108
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:37,960
Here's an inconvenient truth
for you. Nobody cares.

109
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,299
So you think it's OK to
just kill animals for sport?

110
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,813
If it serves or use for purpose,
yes I do.

111
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:48,384
Salt?

112
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,336
Crack black pepper?

113
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,489
Thank you, Bingo.

114
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,639
Well, I'll check on you later, son.

115
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,862
<i>Yep, Iraq is just the type of devicing subject,</i>

116
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,599
<i>that would spread around this
damn hospital like wildfire.</i>

117
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:13,055
Poor kid, said he's blown
off...all for nothing.

118
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:19,017
All for nothing? My nephew Lance is over there
fighting to give those people democracy.

119
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,373
Ooh, so that's why we're over there.
Here I thought it was a rude act of terrorism, or

120
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:28,899
was it for the oil? Or for mama Hussein
secret Falafel rest I've been ashklashf...

121
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,777
Gosh, that hard to keep track.

122
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,779
Dude, I hear they have laws
that make women

123
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,201
completely cover their
bodies, when around in public.

124
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:40,704
The war in I-raq? Try the war
to C-rack. [the bra sustaining part]

125
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,711
Do you get it, Turk? All the
terrorists want to do is kill you.

126
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,036
They want to kill you.

127
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,885
- Elliot, if you...
- Kill you!

128
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,983
You guys, in case I find an apartment I like...
I need someone to write a reference for me.

129
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,604
J.D., we're in the middle of something.

130
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,778
Elliot, the only good that's come
from our occupation of Iraq

131
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,792
is exposing the neo-conservative
conspiracy to prepatch with the american

132
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:05,983
- cultural/economical imperialism!
- What do you think, JD?

133
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:07,802
Can you excuse me a second?!

134
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:10,513
Did you bring her back in
stubbing a newspapers?

135
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,106
Carla is making me normally up when
I go near things after the funnies.

136
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:15,077
Oh, of course the funnies!
The funnies don't count,

137
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,634
by the way dream what would i do today?

138
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,348
Can you believe your pizza
delivery guy outbowl is a tip?

139
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:23,085
No, but that's what's going about momma
dookie is always sticking on his feet.

140
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:25,110
- I think you mean "pause".
- No!

141
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,613
-Shh!
- Shh! Sorry!

142
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,306
- Let's keep it real.
- Jeez.

143
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,216
- Well, JD...the war?
- I don't have time for this, Elliot.

144
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,433
I have to find an apartment.

145
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:37,217
If you get the chance, read the Boone
Docks. Man, that little kid hates hunkies!

146
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:38,747
Ha ha! Who doesn't?!

147
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,798
Typical Dorian. Running away from an
argument you know nothing about.

148
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,685
- I know all about the war.
- Really?

149
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:48,667
Point to Iraq.

150
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:51,710
Why do you keep a globe
on your janitor cart?

151
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,613
Guess i get lost. I'll give you a hand.
It's not the countryship like a boot.

152
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:56,947
That's Iraq.

153
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,131
- That's China.
- You're China.

154
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,692
Some rageous accusation.

155
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:09,726
Need salt. Where's my bunny? Bingo?

156
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:18,441
So, this is a picture of my unit after we
secured the bridge outside of...of Fallujah.

157
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,697
And...oh, here's my unit
when we're playing poker.

158
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,797
And...wheew...uhm...

159
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,657
This is a...picture of my unit.

160
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:31,206
I was gonna send it to my girlfriend
but...she broke up with me.

161
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,778
Well, send it to her anyway...she
should know what she's missing.

162
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,118
Sir?

163
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:38,216
<i>I like this kid. He gets me.</i>

164
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:44,065
No, i was in the Navy. It's important to
remember the good men that you serve with.

165
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:48,391
That's why i carry around a a little
reminder of my buddy Johhny.

166
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:50,933
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

167
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,105
Fantastic!

168
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,902
And Johhny got a tattoo on the same
cheek that says "Bobby".

169
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,484
He probably doesn't regret that at all

170
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:05,360
No, you just can't find that
kind of bond in civilian life.

171
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:10,096
Although I've often wondered what my life
would be like if I'd stayed in the Service.

172
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:23,254
<i>* "Up Where we Belong" from "An officer
and a gentleman" in Vietnamian *</i>

173
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:31,934
<i>* "Up Where we Belong" in Vietnamian *</i>

174
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,602
I would have asked to be
stationed in South East Asia...

175
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:37,871
...for the food.

176
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,077
You goin' crap wise all you lots. But all the
boys over there are doing the Lord's will.

177
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:44,494
And when you say Lord you
mean Halliburton, right?

178
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,842
Ok, who here thinks democracy
is worth fighting for?

179
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:50,128
- Me! - I do!
- Yeah! - Oh yeah!

180
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:54,051
Who here thinks we were manupulated by
false claims of WMDs ?

181
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,910
- We're here!
- We do! - Me!

182
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,504
Neat. Everyone's sitting
on the appropriate side.

183
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:04,898
- Ted, what do you think?
- I think both sides have valid points.

184
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,883
Why d'you take a stand, Swept Balls?

185
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:11,310
Oh, you liberals survey and every
american agrees with you,

186
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,474
that's why Jonh Kerry and
Al Gore built one in landslides.

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,584
Oh, my God. Elliot, you're
one of them, aren't you?

188
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:27,535
You know what? I don't need to be ashamed
of this, anymore. Yes, I'm a Republican.

189
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,123
- Me too!
- Me too.

190
00:10:31,777 --> 00:10:32,437
Elliot!

191
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,505
Me too.

192
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,447
President Reagan? Should
be on or under Bob Dole?

193
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:44,400
How about another time?

194
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:48,734
- WHat do you think about Hillary?
- I hate that bitch.

195
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,758
Oh!

196
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,956
<i>Hot toc, 2.15, thunder values</i>

197
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,848
<i>There comes a time talking to
young Private Dancer, though.</i>

198
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,681
<i>You've seen your shirt, Private
Dancer, haven't you, kid?</i>

199
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,231
<i>Hm hm. Sure have, Bob. Sure have.</i>

200
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:08,702
- What is it, Slugathor?
- Uhm, Dr. Kelso, i've a patient who has

201
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:11,604
a Mild's fever, but I don't know who to
talk to, beacuse everyone's arguing.

202
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,159
Sluggy, if you want to get people's attention

203
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:17,602
you've got to be more aggressive
or more attractive, pick one.

204
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,742
<i>I should keep an eye on that.</i>

205
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,131
<i>*Cox and Nurse Roberts arguing*</i>

206
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,356
<i>*Cox and Nurse Roberts arguing*
See, a hospital</i>

207
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,260
<i>*Elliot and Turk arguing*
is a complex machine,</i>

208
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:24,551

00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,579
<i>*Cox and Nurse Roberts arguing* ???

210
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,191
<i>Balls can be dropped.</i>

211
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,819
<i>and the ones who end up soffering the most
are the one that we are here to protect.</i>

212
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:42,431
Good morning Private Dancer

213
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:44,540
Son?!

214
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,958
Get respiratory for a blood-gas
and set up for a lombar puncture!

215
00:11:58,382 --> 00:11:59,520
He's stable.

216
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:01,854
Whose fault is this?

217
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:05,668
<i>* Turk, Elliot and Cox exculpating *</i>

218
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,159
<i>They need a leader Bob, give them one.</i>

219
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,238
That's enough!

220
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,330
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!

221
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,546
Just a second on the yelling there Bob

222
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:20,480
Do you think you can actually be an
absentee chief of medicine and still matter?

223
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:23,152
Let me see if I can make this real clear for you.

224
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:27,342
If this hospital were a human
body, you'd be the appendix

225
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,900
because at one time you served some function,

226
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:33,907
but it was so long ago, nobody is
quite sure what that was...anymore.

227
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,849
'Xcuse us, we're gonna
talk it out over here.

228
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,378
<i>Well, you've got what you asked for, Bob.</i>

229
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,876
<i>They don't need you.</i>

230
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,034
Hey, son.

231
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,503
How're you doing?

232
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:58,674
Well, even though non one ever comes

233
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,698
everytime I hit this nurse's
button, I feel a little better.

234
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,032
That's morphine.

235
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:04,670
That explains it.

236
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,091
Hey, uhm, thanks for checkin' in on me.

237
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,528
You're all like my Sergeant.

238
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:12,906
Sergeant Bourne.

239
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:18,588
He was hands-on, too. Always
trying to be in the game.

240
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,915
<i>That's how you get people around
you to listen to you, Bob.</i>

241
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,717
<i>Be like this kid's Sergeant,
and get back in the game.</i>

242
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:29,538
<i>Right after you follow that coop cake,
if she'd put it down for even a second</i>

243
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,435
<i>it's yours! No! Now, dammit!</i>

244
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:33,765
Hey, buddy,

245
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,049
<i>You've found an apartment yet?</i>

246
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:39,245
No, man, i feel like an idiot so i've been
reading up on this whole Iraq war situation.

247
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,699
You know what's so messed up? I just
got to the power President Bush

248
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,843
gave his "mission accomplished"
speech on a battleship,

249
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:45,844
and i still got 400 more pages to go.

250
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,644
Hey, uhm, i gotta go.

251
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,675
All right, listen up people.

252
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,471
I am here to roll at my sleeves

253
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:57,585
and put an end to all this nonsense
so that we can go back to work.

254
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:02,756
We are working. You see, even though
we currently despise each other,

255
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,712
we're professionals. For example,

256
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:09,351
I can lend Barbie a hand
despite the fact that she is a heartless

257
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,719
"red state" supporting , NRA backing
and illegal immigrant hating

258
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:17,487
self-righteous missing form dope
essentially Karl Rove with smaller boobs.

259
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,579
And I can help out Dr. Cox,
even though he got a punch

260
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,743
demming his piss on the government
until Jabar's cropped

261
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:26,198
this team a condo of anthrax,
and PR listening out frankly face.

262
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,508
You know if you're really serious about
helping out I can use a hand of my

263
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,273
to-do list... I need to...

264
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,912
...clean the toilets? I'm just tired
of staring at that. Good-bye.

265
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:42,428
I need the Tivo crossing over V-Jap networks,
i need to turn a cat into a spice rack,

266
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,549
and I need to return this
thing to the patient in 307.

267
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,763
All doable, don't need you. Thanks!

268
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,767
So, nobody needs any help.

269
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,474
When is your wife coming back to work?

270
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,523
I'm drowning here without
the Head Nurse.

271
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,802
Ok, ladies, I posted your room assignments
on the board and we'll pass out

272
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,429
the new weekly schedules
before your shifts are over.

273
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:13,145
Being a nurse isn't so bad.

274
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,336
What did you think
it would be like?

275
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,938
We're losing him.

276
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,268
BP's falling.

277
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:23,131
Nurse Kelso I need
1 mg of epy! Stack!

278
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,378
Now nurse, now!

Way to go Bob, way to go! That a boy!

281
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,797
I'm sorry what
was the question?

282
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:55,853
Jumbo Latte for Dr. Reid,
with the employee discount.

283
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,722
- YEAAAH!
- YEAAAH!

284
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,921
- Employee's discount
- YEAAH!

285
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,370
Uhm, neat.

286
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:07,284
Would you like to see something
else that's really neat?

287
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:09,208
Check out to this quote written on your cup.

288
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,836
"I enjoy laughing at poor people"

289
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,739
Elliot Reid - April 2006

290
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,977
When I said that, I was watching "Good Time"!

291
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,253
That's gonna be on every Jumbo Cup for
a month, courtesy of my anti-war peeps.

292
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,553
Can I get a hell HEAH?

293
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:25,562
HELL YEAH!!

294
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,126
OH YEAH!!

295
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:30,539
Typical lame liberal tactic,
taking something out of context

296
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
in order to defame someone's integrity.
Am I right my pro-war amigos?

297
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:39,330
- YEAH!!
- OH YEAH!!

298
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:40,627
Gods, there seems to be a lot of

299
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:44,011
high volume over enthusiastic
opinion sharing, going on today.

300
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,148
I think I'll join it.

301
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,645
- Employee discount!
- OH YEAAAH!

302
00:16:56,543 --> 00:17:00,454
- Ok...I've...I've seen enough.
- Replying that.

303
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,756
Uhm, consider that a little gift
from Nurse Roberts' nephew,

304
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,321
Corporal Roberts.

305
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,896
Hell, yeah!

306
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:23,047
Ok, Janice I'm going to need you to
make sure Mr. Jeffers gets his meds,

307
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:26,861
and FYI, don't lean over him, he's handsy.

308
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:31,640
and Denise, could you do me a major large
and cover Jessica shift this weekend?

309
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,314
I have to have a pap smear.

310
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:37,946
Have you seen Georgina lately? She
looks like she's been eating for two...

311
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,917
- Oh, stop it!
- You stop it.

312
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,961
Oh, Nurse Kelso, ooh,
purple is not your color.

313
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:46,860
Listen, could you con out the
housekeeping and maybe send up

314
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:49,348
some fresh scrubs for me
and--psst, come here.

315
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,443
Please put on a bra, you're distracting
some of the other doctors.

316
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,008
<i>Let him joke, you look spippy
and you're doing great.</i>

317
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:02,037
Why did he tell me to give meds to Mr.
Jeffers? I did that five minutes ago.

318
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,651
Girl, just homily. He'll be outta here, eventually.

319
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,506
Private, I'm gonna let you
hand on a little secret.

320
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,914
That you were never in the navy,
and Johnny is your husband?

321
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,324
If only.

322
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,497
<i> I love you, Johnny.</i>

323
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:24,167
Your fighting in that war has provoked some
pretty idiot argument amongst the staff.

324
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:30,335
See, the thing is they think they can
just put their squabbles in a box

325
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,940
that won't affect their work.
But they're wrong.

326
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:38,271
I mean... judging from the
coffee stains on Dr. Cox's scrubs

327
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:41,447
and the quote on this coffee cup attributed to Dr. Reid

328
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:46,645
"My bagingo's on fire"
May 2004

329
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,748
What's a "Bagingo"?

330
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,190
Eventually, your page is gonna go unreturned

331
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:56,413
your test isn't gonna get run as quickly
as they should have been, and

332
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,692
sounds like kids like yourself
gonna pay the price.

333
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:04,557
What bothers me about it,
is that I know this is going on,

334
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,120
but there's nothing I can do to change it.

335
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:07,341
Why not?

336
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,989
Let's just say that 'round here I'm not
as loved as your sergent was.

337
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,254
We hated Sgt. Bourne

338
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,096
- Come again?
- Yeah, he demeaned us, overworked us.

339
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:24,828
Still, maybe sometimes that's
what being a good leader is...

340
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:34,083
...uniting everybody...by
giving them someone to hate.

341
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:38,143
All right, listen up gang.
I'm only going to say this once.

342
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,909
<i>All right Bob, time to bring it home</i>

343
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:46,849
From this point on there will be
no more employee discounts, here.

344
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,642
Everyone pays full price,

345
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:53,397
except for me, of course.
Where's my Jumbo latte?

346
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,171
You mind telling us why?

347
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,463
Why the hell not?

348
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:01,627
<i>That i will do it.</i>

349
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:04,939
<i>[ people complaining ]</i>

350
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:11,362
<i>Since I've spent this afternoon
researching the war in Iraq,</i>

351
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,811
<i>I couldn't wait to dive right
into the spirit of debate.</i>

352
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:17,847
- What a jackass!

353
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,256
Come on, no one wants to debate Iraq with me?

354
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:24,828
- I'll debate Iraq with you.
- Prepare to be dazzled.

355
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,881
Ok, in my opinion we should be
looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.

356
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,033
You've that globe nearby?

357
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,798
<i>In life it seems we all have a role to play...</i>

358
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,551
<i>...someone of us are meant to be loved...</i>

359
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:44,214
<i>...and some of us, unfortunately,
are meant to be hated.</i>

360
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:47,093
Good night minions, Slugathor.

361
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,055
<i>For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have
it any other way [love, TN]</i>
