1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,638
<i>[J.D.] Turk and Carla were converting</i>
<i>my old bedroom into a nursery,</i>

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,969
<i>so I helped paint a mural</i>
<i>for the new baby.</i>

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,969
- Done.
- [Carla] Oh, hell no!

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,502
Is that big, ugly one
shooting laser beams into the crib?

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,946
That's Optimus Prime.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,281
I don't think he'd appreciate
you calling him the big, ugly one.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,649
- No, he wouldn't.
- No.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,880
Not Optimus.

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,391
If Junior gets scared,
he can always climb into bed with us.

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,586
- That's what I did with my mom.
- What do you mean "did"?

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,757
Last Christmas, I walked in on Turk
and his mom cuddling together in bed.

12
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,699
<i>[J.D.] Turk gets defensive</i>
<i>when it comes to his mother.</i>

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,862
You're jealous 'cause your mom's dead.

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,633
Whoa! We should probably take a break.

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,574
You'll finish building that crib
like you promised.

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,409
You are driving to the cemetery,
cleaning up my mom's grave,

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,641
and asking her for forgiveness.

18
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,309
I hate having to ask for forgiveness.

19
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,117
How's my mom doing?

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,057
I asked if she still hated me
and the sprinklers came on.

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,653
Give her time.
She's only been dead for three years.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,824
But, baby, it's too soon
to be putting a nursery together,

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,234
test driving minivans,
or buying baby monitors.

24
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,795
<i>[J.D. Over monitor]</i>
<i>I can't get this crib together.</i>

25
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,036
<i>And can somebody please</i>
<i>bring me a glass of water?</i>

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,205
You go this time.

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,247
Thank you.

28
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,011
<i>[J.D.] Thinking about Turk and Carla</i>
<i>becoming parents</i>

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,054
<i>made me think of my mom</i>
<i>and how much she probably misses me.</i>

30
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:32,353
<i>I bet she wishes she could see what life</i>
<i>is like around here through my eyes.</i>

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,121
<i>And that's why I strapped</i>
<i>my video camera to my head.</i>

32
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,960
- Morning, weirdo.
- Lonnie.

33
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,798
<i>[J.D.] It was the perfect idea.</i>
<i>She got to meet my superiors.</i>

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,971
That's right, the old man
stole some ice cream.

35
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,566
<i>[J.D.] I even got some great footage</i>
<i>of Dr. Cox.</i>

36
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:55,307
- Where the hell have you been?
- I'm making a video postcard.

37
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,111
- Do you have a message for my mom?
- No.

38
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,414
But since she brought you
into the world,

39
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,614
I do have a message for her uterus.

40
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,214
Bad uterus!
Don't do that anymore.

41
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,193
She had a hysterectomy, but I'm sure
I can just edit over that part.

42
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,752
Let's go see Mr. McNair.

43
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,957
<i>[J.D.] Mr. McNair</i>
<i>had locked-in syndrome,</i>

44
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,592
<i>a paralysis so severe</i>
<i>he could only communicate</i>

45
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,671
<i>through a computer</i>
<i>that responds to his eye movements.</i>

46
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,501
Check his vitals, Eva.

47
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,736
<i>[Computer] Why does he</i>
<i>call you a girl's name?</i>

48
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,675
Thank you for asking, Mr. McNair.

49
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,203
You see, the thing about Dr. Cox
is the closer he feels to a person,

50
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,250
the more he needs to push them away.

51
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,617
When he calls me Eva, he's actually
saying, "J.D., I care about you."

52
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,625
- Vulnerable people like...
<i>- [computer] Oh, my God. I get it now.</i>

53
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,423
<i>Carol. Carol, Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,464
- Now you're being a jerk.
<i>- Carol...</i>

55
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,897
- Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!
<i>- Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>

56
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,934
- Newbie!
- What?

57
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,595
I'm relatively certain
the computer is broken.

58
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,070
<i>- Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>
- My bad.

59
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,137
<i>[J.D.] I felt bad for Mr. McNair,</i>
<i>but I was off until six tonight,</i>

60
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,045
<i>so I decided to grab</i>
<i>a quick nap in the sun.</i>

61
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,889
[J.D.] What the...? Ah!

62
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,325
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

63
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,795
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

64
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,963
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

65
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,273
- [Turk] Where the hell is J.D.?
- [Carla] He's off until six.

66
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,642
Any second now, he's gonna walk
through that door, lost in his thoughts.

67
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,911
<i>[Janitor] With Dorian taken care of,</i>
<i>I'm not sure how I should spend my day.</i>

68
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,080
<i>I suppose I could clean.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

69
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,488
<i>God help me,</i>
<i>that one still makes me laugh.</i>

70
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,994
<i>Oh, no, it's black Kojak</i>
<i>and Scary Nurse-Wife.</i>

71
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,190
<i>I'll get rid of them</i>
<i>with an innocuous compliment.</i>

72
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,324
You are glowing.

73
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,429
<i>[Janitor] Free and clear.</i>

74
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,664
Have you seen J.D.?

75
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,439
Where am I?

76
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,173
Hello?

77
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,511
Anyone?

78
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,509
No, I don't know where he is.

79
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,249
<i>[Janitor] I love that adrenaline rush</i>
<i>you get from lying to someone's face.</i>

80
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,290
<i>Do it again.</i>

81
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,256
Dr. Kelso,

82
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,285
I must say that your nose hair is not
long and creepy like most old guys.

83
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,922
Thank you.

84
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,134
Hey, Perry, great shirt!

85
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,564
Wish I'd thought of athletic apparel
when going through my midlife crisis.

86
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,008
It'd have been cheaper than a
cigarette boat named <i>Dr. Feelgood.</i>

87
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,179
That laughing had better not be aimed
in my direction, bro.

88
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:49,187
Bro? Dude, bros don't even use "bro."
You're not as hip as you think you are.

89
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,916
And you are?

90
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,715
I'm black.

91
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,316
God knew my people
would go through struggles,

92
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,829
so he gave us a lifetime supply of cool.

93
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,162
Like he knew white people
would be rhythmically challenged

94
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,667
and he gave you this dance.

95
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,204
You're black?

96
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,571
'Cause, last I checked,
you had a nerdy white best friend,

97
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,303
you enjoy Neil Diamond,

98
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,607
and you damn sure act
like a black guy.

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,049
And these, my friend,
are all characteristics of white guys.

100
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,882
Now, please understand,
I'm a huge supporter of the NAACP.

101
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,220
That stands for the National Association
For The Advancement Of Colored People.

102
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:30,388
And quite frankly, I always thought
they should change "Colored People"

103
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,760
to "African-Americans."

104
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,994
But then it wouldn't be the NAACP,

105
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,832
it would be the "N quad A,"
or NAAAA.

106
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,997
I know this probably sounds
like a digression,

107
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,804
but it actually leads me
back to my original point:

108
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,003
Do I think you're black?

109
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,139
Nah.

110
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,146
Knock, knock.

111
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,187
<i>[Janitor] Who's there?</i>
<i>Nurse Mophead.</i>

112
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,451
<i>Nurse Mophead, who?</i>
<i>You have a mophead.</i>

113
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,118
Well, your new computer
should be here tonight.

114
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,955
She got out of here in a hurry,
didn't she?

115
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,897
I know what that's like,
when people say the minimum.

116
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,095
But with me it's usually,
"Mop that floor. Clean that counter.

117
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,229
Stop provoking that bear."

118
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,796
Want me to keep you company?

119
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,707
I don't mind. I'm just working
on my own stuff anyway.

120
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,871
I'm a bit of an inventor.
I'm gonna show you my latest one:

121
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,681
Pen straw.

122
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,386
Perfect. Ahem!

123
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,718
Except I don't like that cola.

124
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,951
It tastes like ink. [sighs]

125
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,789
But that's just one.
I got a million ideas.

126
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,792
I don't care if he is on the first
floor, I need this cleaned up now!

127
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,937
I'm here. Open up the window.

128
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,972
That was quick.

129
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,639
I call it the Hover Hoover.

130
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,108
Where suction meets the sky.

131
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,241
That's a good question. Only problem
is I've answered it five times.

132
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,613
Dr. Reid, would you mind
explaining to me

133
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,549
why you called the chief of surgery

134
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,145
to consult on a cellulitis patient
yesterday?

135
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,588
I wasn't even here yesterday.

136
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,559
Your interns were.
Their mistakes are your mistakes.

137
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,359
Whether it's an unnecessary consult,
or his ridiculous haircut.

138
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,093
This cost $60.

139
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,432
Let's hope your stylist
put that money towards rehab.

140
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,606
Darn it. I'm sick and tired
of your careless mistakes.

141
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,674
Why isn't this bleeder on telemetry?

142
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,936
I know you had a 12-hour
shift yesterday,

143
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,980
but that is no excuse for not
turning in your histories.

144
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,278
You dragged me to dinner
and made me play <i>Scrabble</i> all night.

145
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,615
How you spend your private life
isn't my responsibility, OK?

146
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
Fine. I'll do them tonight.

147
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,418
You're taking me to the movies.
Get on the ball.

148
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,653
All of you, go work.

149
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,996
Wow.

150
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,531
Aren't you the big badass attending?

151
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,035
It's time for them to sink or swim.
I got to where I am on my own, OK?

152
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,263
Nobody helped you out in the beginning?

153
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,796
Dr. Cox was my attending. He kept
track of the times he made me cry.

154
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,435
Twenty-seven, counting this morning.

155
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,071
Yeah, I'm PMS'ing
and he made fun of my shoes.

156
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,742
Laverne, what are you doing out here?

157
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,343
Tonight's date night with Mr. Roberts

158
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,585
and I like to prime the pump
by watching the young men sweat.

159
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,991
Hey, Dr. Cox, if I wasn't a black man,
could I do this?

160
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,928
That's game, all right!
That's game!

161
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,092
- You got next?
- Yeah, I got next.

162
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,399
They call me the Candyman
'cause my moves are so sweet.

163
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,567
They call me The Pig, because I say
sexist and derogatory things to women.

164
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,202
Lonnie, play with Dr. Cox.

165
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,869
Let's go!

166
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,677
- [Turk laughing]
- Ooh! Ooh!

167
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,117
[Turk laughing] Look at the glasses!
Look at the mouthpiece!

168
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,283
Dr. Turk is not aware that Lonnie
was all-conference at Villanova.

169
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,418
Would you go ahead
and thank what's-his-name for me?

170
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,359
- Jesus?
- That's him.

171
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,090
- Let's go.
- Take ball.

172
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,469
Lisa, why did you order
100 units of insulin for Mrs. Best?

173
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,907
No, that's only 10 units.
I put a smiley face after the zero.

174
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,640
Look, Lisa, you have to be crystal
clear with your medication orders.

175
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,581
<i>- [Beeping]</i>
- OK, it's causing a bit of a seizure.

176
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,209
Hey, Janitor!

177
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,720
Come here!
Hold her legs down, please!

178
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,689
<i>[Janitor] This is it!</i>
<i>I'm in the show! Dr. Jan-itor.</i>

179
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,125
We'll give her an amp of B50.

180
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,129
This is easy.
Just like drowning someone.

181
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,357
<i>[Beeping stops]</i>

182
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,525
OK. You can let her legs go now.
I think we're good.

183
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,900
I didn't see the demon leave the body.

184
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,196
I'm sure it did.

185
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,798
Hey, Janitor, good job.

186
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,109
Good job.

187
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,183
Dr. Reid will kill me
when she finds out about this.

188
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:49,050
Relax. I'll go talk to Dr. Reid.
It won't be a big deal.

189
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,122
What?!

190
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,988
I'm gonna make someone burn for this.
Who did it, Carla?

191
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,122
I didn't realize how much I picked up
from working here.

192
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,862
I heard her yell, "Hold this woman's
legs down," and I just knew what to do.

193
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,699
Good for you.

194
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,502
Now I've got to go meet my husband
at the bus station

195
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,736
and pretend to be a street walker.

196
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,476
Enjoy your date night.

197
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,379
<i>[Janitor] OK, Mr. Cool Guy,</i>
<i>you had your moment of glory.</i>

198
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,940
<i>No need to make a big deal out of it.</i>

199
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,542
Hey!

200
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,384
Slow down, buddy.
What's the hurry? Come here!

201
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,584
I want to tell you
a little story about a hero.

202
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,561
<i>[Janitor] Know what? The hell with it.</i>
<i>It feels good to get a little attention.</i>

203
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,627
<i>I'll tell you one thing,</i>
<i>it beats falling flat on your ass.</i>

204
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,331
Holy moly!

205
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,771
That would've been really embarrassing
if you were black.

206
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,235
Great.

207
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,144
Seriously, Carla, I need to know
who's responsible for this.

208
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,648
<i>[Janitor] Or lying</i>
<i>to cover someone's ass.</i>

209
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,479
I don't know.

210
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,316
It was just a clerical error.
There's no way to trace it.

211
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,847
Was I brave?
"Brave" is a pretty strong word.

212
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,486
Perhaps the better term is "valiant."

213
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,029
Off you go.

214
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,592
<i>[Janitor] Anyway, for once</i>
<i>I didn't feel like a jerk.</i>

215
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,329
Is he still talking
about holding that patient?

216
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:16,034
Give him a break. You know how hard it
is for us to bust our humps every day.

217
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,976
Imagine how it feels being here
knowing you don't make a difference.

218
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,749
# <i>Drill-fork</i>
<i>It can drill and fork</i>

219
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,920
# <i>Mostly fork</i> #

220
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:41,160
I don't care what those people said.
I know I make a difference around here.

221
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,396
Hey, Jill.

222
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,564
They don't know how different
it would be if I wasn't here.

223
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,840
Hey, Jill.

224
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,577
Yep, a lot of lives would change.

225
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,773
I am gonna prove that to them right now.

226
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,180
I am gonna fix your computer.

227
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,744
I just gotta get my real tools.
I've turned these into eating utensils.

228
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,722
Dig in.

229
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,625
- You know what time it is?
<i>- [Janitor] 4:15.</i>

230
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,663
- 3:30.
- Oh, thank goodness.

231
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,633
- I thought I was running late.
<i>- [Janitor] I do love to lie.</i>

232
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,761
Look at my face. Keith, what
does it mean when I'm frowning?

233
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,899
You're feeling insecure and suspicious
that I think someone on television

234
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,306
is prettier than you.

235
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,741
At work, Keith.

236
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,608
Ah...

237
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,172
Keith was half right.
This face means that I am suspicious.

238
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,615
I was reviewing records.

239
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,654
Mrs. Best received
an inordinate amount of insulin.

240
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,724
- I wanna know who screwed up.
- [Carla] Elliot?

241
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,817
You're wasting your time.
You know how interns stick together.

242
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:48,833
- They'll never rat each other out.
- I am sleeping with one of the interns.

243
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:54,066
Seeing as I've gotten Keith to pee
sitting down so there's no splatter,

244
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,505
I'm betting I'll be able
to get him to talk.

245
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,070
Keith!

246
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,679
Meet me in the caf in half an hour.

247
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,181
Keith, you better not
tell her who did it.

248
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,809
But Elliot scares me.

249
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:11,255
Elliot is a blonde, 108-pound ski pole
from a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.

250
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,622
I am an underpaid pregnant nurse
from the block,

251
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,060
who, over the next six months,
will become fatter and angrier.

252
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,065
- Now, who are you really afraid of?
- The fatty.

253
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,862
Be careful, Keith.

254
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh, I love it!

255
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,430
And you know, they say it's
the safest thing we can do for our baby.

256
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,636
- Can we get it?
- No, no, no.

257
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:38,206
Let's take it back before somebody
sees me. As a matter of fact, get down!

258
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,253
Hey! [laughs]

259
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,980
<i>[Dinging]</i>

260
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:47,355

[Honks]

262
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,985
Hate to bother you,
but could you explain again,

263
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,554
what's it like to be a young,
hip black guy?

264
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,193
You see, Dr. Cox, what I'm gonna do
is we're gonna pimp this out.

265
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,569
We're gonna throw some 22s on it,
put some spinners on the 22s...

266
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,269
Ooh! And a DVD player
so the kids can watch Elmo.

267
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,572
You're killing me.

268
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:11,275
<i>[Janitor] Sometimes, around here,</i>
<i>it feels like humiliation is contagious.</i>

269
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,447
Mr. McNair,
I didn't exactly fix your computer.

270
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,151
I think I might have voided
your warranty.

271
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,389
Elliot, I am not gonna tell you
who messed up with Mrs. Best.

272
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,431
Oh, no problem.
I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee.

273
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,023
Oh, and introduce you to my mom.

274
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,468
[Laughs] Mom.
That makes me sound so old.

275
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,940
I had C-sections with all my kids,
so everything is as it was down there.

276
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,739
Uh, very nice to meet you, Mrs. Reid.

277
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,246
You and Elliot
would have such cute babies.

278
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,283
She's only got about
five more years to pop one out.

279
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,046
- Have you ever seen chubby Elliot?
- Uh, no.

280
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,055
If you want to see it,
break up and wait a couple of weeks.

281
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,854
When she's depressed, she hits
a bag of Doritos like there's diamonds.

282
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,088
- Love you too, Mom.
<i>- [Phone rings]</i>

283
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,689
Ah! That's your dad.
How did you get this number?

284
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,467
Like her? If you don't tell me
which intern messed up,

285
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,163
I'll beg her to move here.

286
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,607
She's just a little weird, Elliot.
I can handle weird.

287
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:13,979
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,981
The light just hit you so perfectly,
I had to have a taste.

289
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,280
- No, not you.
- It was Lisa.

290
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,446
I would have told you earlier,
but someone told me not to.

291
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,387
Who told you not to?

292
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,127
Baby, you're not really bothered
by what Dr. Cox said, are you?

293
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,891
- You know you're my black prince.
- That's not it.

294
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,126
I know I'm black.
I'm reminded all the time.

295
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,997
Patient doesn't want a black doctor,

296
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,400
people think I know the score
to every NBA game,

297
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,371
and I told you what happened last week

298
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,068
when the new board member
met the surgical staff.

299
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,667
Nice to meet you.

300
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,473
Nice to meet you.

301
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,514
Nice to meet you.

302
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,481
Hey, what's up, dawg?

303
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,918
Nice to meet you.

304
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,813
It's not even about that.

305
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:02,084
It's about the nursery.
It's about that stupid minivan.

306
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,029
I don't know if you know this, but
overnight I went from Chris Turk, Stud,

307
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,328
to Grandpa Turk,
the guy who wears overalls

308
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,630
and does embarrassing dances
at cookouts.

309
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,638
You do that now.

310
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,408
But in a cool way.

311
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,275
Hey. Thanks to your little
telling-me-the wrong-time prank,

312
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,144
I was 45 minutes late
for my Oriental massage.

313
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,185
Which meant that instead of Pang-Wa,
I had to settle for Ching-Lau.

314
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,780
- So?
- Ching-Lau is a dude!

315
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:36,226
You know, I've accepted the fact
that you're useless around here.

316
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:40,061
Maybe you could just try a little
harder not to make things worse.

317
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,532
Know what he doesn't get?
I could have been a janitor anywhere.

318
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,594
When I got out of college, I had offers.
Morgan-Stanley, Dupont...

319
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,608
I even considered taking a year off
and cleaning my way across Europe.

320
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,304
But no, I chose a hospital.

321
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,476
I'm not kidding myself. I don't have
the most important job in the world,

322
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,110
but I work in a place that helps people,
and I thought I was part of that.

323
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,946
Who cares.

324
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,625
- Have you seen Carla?
- [Cox] Nope.

325
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,826
My turn. Have you seen how stupid you
look when you do your angry quick-walk?

326
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,574
Carla covered for one of my interns
and then lied to my face about it.

327
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,410
Come on. Of course she did.

328
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,781
If an intern got hammered and stripped
of what little self-confidence they have

329
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,912
every time they messed up,
there wouldn't be any left.

330
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,753
Luckily, Carla happens
to have been here long enough

331
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,555
to identify when someone
needs to be protected.

332
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,995
- These kids need to stand on their...
- Got that right, sister.

333
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,034
Because you definitely
got where you are on your own.

334
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:53,400
- You sure didn't give me any help.
- I didn't say I did.

335
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,649
[Carla] It's OK.
It's not a big deal.

336
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,676
- But Dr. Cox is gonna kill me.
- Dr. Cox doesn't have to find out.

337
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,757
Just promise you'll practice
repositioning the swans.

338
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,758
- I promise.
- OK.

339
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,823
Turk, I get it.

340
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,426
Having a baby changes things.

341
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,598
I just don't want to say goodbye
to the life we have now.

342
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,301
Well, baby, you don't have to.

343
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,538
We'll still have fun,
go to bars, go dancing...

344
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,203
- Really?
- No.

345
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,374
We'll have a baby.
That would be crazy.

346
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,145
Just focus on the positives.

347
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:43,586
For instance,
we'll still have lots of sex.

348
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,418
- Really?
- No!

349
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,860
But I can tell you that this is normal.

350
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,691
You'll get through it.

351
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:58,993
Come to think of it, what would
really help me get through it...

352
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,104
[humming]

353
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,508
[Giggling]

354
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,046
Man, you're gullible today.

355
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,377
Well, Mr. McNair,

356
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,548
I hope you don't mind me
hanging out all day talking to you.

357
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,758
I don't think you do mind.
I got a seventh sense about that.

358
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,797
My sixth sense is I can tell
when squirrels are afraid.

359
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,964
Anyway, I know you lost your computer

360
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,561
and I thought maybe you
were a little bit Ionely.

361
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,664
I've been Ionely around here
a couple times.

362
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,035
I don't know. I just hope I helped.

363
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,047
Nobody's buying it.
Your new computer is finally here.

364
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,412
Sorry it took so long.

365
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,951
- What time is it?
- 6:00.

366
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,455
[Yelling]

367
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,194
How was your day?

368
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,566
Cold.

369
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,535
<i>[Janitor] Now help him up so he thinks</i>
<i>there's hope for our relationship yet.</i>

370
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,469
<i>[J.D.] Even though the Janitor</i>
<i>had kidnapped me,</i>

371
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,002
<i>when he helped me up, I felt there</i>
<i>was hope for our relationship yet.</i>

372
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,982
<i>Being locked up all day makes you</i>
<i>appreciate the things that matter.</i>

373
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,542
[# Augustana: <i>Boston]</i>

374
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,386
Did I ever thank you for all the help
that you've given me over the years?

375
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,651
Don't sweat it.

376
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,591
<i>[J.D.] Like the support of a friend.</i>

377
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,761
<i>The importance of family.</i>

378
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,733
What up, dawg?

379
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,861
You know I'm down to play ball,

380
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:43,306
I just gotta drop Junior off with old
lady at the ducky park, yeah.

381
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,707
Yeah, then we're gonna hoop it up.

382
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,505
This isn't really gonna work for me.
I can't do it. I can't.

383
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,279
<i>[J.D.] Or realizing you actually do</i>
<i>make a difference.</i>

384
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,312
- And there you go, Mr. McNair.
<i>- [Computer] Thank you.</i>

385
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,516
Don't mention it.

386
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,161
<i>I wasn't talking to you.</i>
