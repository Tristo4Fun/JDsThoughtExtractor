[# Toto: <i>Africa</i>]

2
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:04,027
<i>[J.D.] Living with Elliot</i>
<i>was certainly different.</i>

3
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:12,044
<i>Every inch of her apartment</i>
<i>was filled with girly stuff.</i>

4
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,604
<i>There were lavender-scented candles...</i>

5
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,784
<i>... curling utensils, pink robes...</i>

6
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,752
<i>... bath salts.</i>

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:25,090
<i>It was awesome.</i>

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,127
<i>My first day off in weeks.</i>
<i>Only one thing could make it better.</i>

9
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,152
<i>Cranking up the Toto.</i>

10
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,434
# <i>I bless the rains down in Africa</i>

[hums]

12
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,700
Mango body butter?

13
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:45,766
Mmm.

14
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:52,917
[Beeping]

15
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,815
Damn it! Always when I'm eating!

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,151
<i>[J.D.] Even though it sucks</i>
<i>being paged by an intern,</i>

17
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,397
<i>there's nothing I like more</i>
<i>than riding my scooter, Sasha,</i>

18
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,534
<i>through puddles after a rain,</i>
<i>and here comes a big 'un!</i>

19
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,195
Where was I?

20
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,312
You're not aware of any sort
of odd underground canal system

21
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,789
beneath the hospital, are you?

22
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:38,096
- I think I saw a manatee.
- Was his name Julian?

23
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:41,500
- We didn't exchange pleasantries.
- That's Julian.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,024
Watch it, wet paint.

25
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,739
Kelso's starting a new line system
to help people get around.

26
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,708
Green's gonna go to the
smokers' lounge, blue to the ICU,

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,346
- yellow to all the exits.
- What's red for?

28
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,177
Sneaker painting.

29
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,518
Ahh! Not gonna happen, pal.

30
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:02,187
For that one to work, you need to spray
first and then say "sneaker painting."

31
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:04,155
Have a good one.

32
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,929
Hey, smart guy. Whatever you do,
don't follow the purple line.

33
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,490
<i>[J.D.] Huh. I never noticed</i>
<i>that door before.</i>

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,704
<i>Probably just a trick,</i>
<i>but what if it isn't?</i>

35
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,943
<i>What if it actually leads someplace?</i>

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,882
<i>Someplace grand, like Narnia?</i>

37
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:32,042
Sneaker painting.

38
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,271
Am I right?

39
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,387
So you think it's perfectly OK
to have sex with your first cousin?

40
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:12,224
Family reunion next month.
I'm going for it. On the coats.

41
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:17,457
- I didn't know what I was high-fiving.
- Always know what you're high-fiving.

42
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,461
OK, I'm here.
What's the emergency, Keith?

43
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,971
Do you want Mr. Fleming
on unfractionated

44
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,375
or low molecular weight heparin?

45
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,978
They're the exact same thing.
Every doctor here knows that.

46
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,344
- Why would you page me?
- Because I told him to.

47
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:38,550
And I know what you're thinking,
Dorothy.

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,086
Why would I have your intern call you in
on one of your very precious days off

49
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,054
for something so gosh-darn trivial?

50
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,125
But the real question ought to be,
why, when you were an intern,

51
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,855
did you call me in
time after time after time

52
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,860
because your patient's stitch
popped out,

53
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,734
or you couldn't remember
where the cotton balls were,

54
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,603
or, and this was the kicker,
you wanted to go pants shopping

55
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,571
and needed somebody totally honest.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,409
So now, to commemorate the first of many
unnecessary disruptions of your life,

57
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,674
I've invited Laverne's church choir here

58
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,014
to summarize my feelings
in exuberant song.

59
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:15,420
# <i>Payback is a bitch</i>
<i>Payback is a bitch</i>

60
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,957
# <i>Payback is a bitch</i>
<i>Payback is a bitch</i>

61
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:22,694
# <i>Payback is a bitch</i>
<i>Payback is a bitch</i>

62
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,423
- You feelin' it?
- I'm feelin' it.

63
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,900
I got it in my leg. It's in my leg.

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,802
I can't even stop it.

65
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,538
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

66
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,837
# <i>No, I know I'm no Superman</i>

67
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,807
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

68
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,207
<i>[J.D.] The worst thing</i>
<i>about going in on your day off</i>

69
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,310
<i>is that it's almost impossible</i>
<i>to get back home.</i>

70
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,720
<i>There's always somebody</i>
<i>who needs help.</i>

71
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,360
<i>That's why I had to wait until the</i>
<i>perfect opportunity to make my break.</i>

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,328
<i>Fat guy! Go, go, go!</i>

73
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:03,897
Dorian, I need you to do the residents'
call schedules for next month.

74
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,064
Sir, I'm not even supposed to be here.

75
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,478
Me neither, son. I was one
of the most promising young shortstops

76
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,844
ever to come out
of Altoona, Pennsylvania.

77
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,172
Then came the Dominicans.

78
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:21,686
Long story short, calling them all Pepe
was apparently just racist enough

79
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:24,655
to get me a ban
from the Appalachian Rookie League.

80
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:28,117
Have the schedules on my desk by lunch.

81
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,117
Damn it!

82
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:36,568
Aw. Look at them, Turk.
That's gonna be us someday.

83
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:40,732
How does that not make you nervous? I
mean, what if our kid's out of control?

84
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,637
I was watching <i>Webster</i> last night.

85
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,945
Webster got all into the pancake mix.
I mean all into the pancake mix!

86
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:50,005
Oh, come on, Turk.
That's a stupid sitcom.

87
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,617
I mean, that's a sitcom.

88
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,123
What if, the second our baby's born,
I start screwing things up?

89
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,353
Oh, my God! Hey, little...

90
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,619
Aw... [baby talk]

91
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:07,331
[Babies crying]

92
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,192
Dominoes are crazy.

93
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,777
OK, either the heat
in my office is broken

94
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:21,513
or I drifted off and fantasized
about Rudy Giuliani again.

95
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:24,616
Giuliani? He's not even sexy!
Right, baby?

96
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,744
Ay, Rudy, don't stop.

97
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,015
Carla, we're Democrats!

98
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,292
Relax, she's only fantasizing
'cause you don't satisfy her.

99
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,920
Anyhoo, can someone
take Jack for a minute?

100
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,594
- No problem!
- Thank you.

101
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,933
- Come on.
- There you go.

102
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,528
Yes.

103
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,638
See, baby? You have nothing
to worry about. I'm great with kids.

104
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:50,574
You don't have to check in as a parent
until you teach our son about sports.

105
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,813
And satisfying women. 'Cause I know
how to satisfy a woman, right, baby?

106
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,337
I'm sure you can.

107
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,719
That's what I'm talking about.

108
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,989
- Done. And I am outta here.
- [Beeping]

109
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,354
Damn it!

110
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,829
Keith, you've got to stop paging me
for totally unimportant things.

111
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:11,989
Oh!

112
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:15,800
That man's chest cavity is completely
open. I can see his heart beating.

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,530
He sneezed
and all his surgical staples popped out.

114
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,672
Good page, Keith, good page!

115
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,543
OK, rocktors... That's my name
for doctors who rock. Next patient.

116
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:28,603
<i>[J.D.] Since her fellowship,</i>
<i>Elliot loved that her interns</i>

117
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,415
<i>saw her as an endocrinology expert.</i>

118
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,619
Dr. Reid, why would Mr. Baum
develop new onset diabetes

119
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,780
and high blood pressure
simultaneously?

120
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,025
Well, as an endocrinology expert,
in my expert opinion,

121
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,561
both can be expertly explained by an
adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome.

122
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,324
Hate to burst your bubble, Barbie,

123
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,634
but your endocrinology fellowship
lasted all of five days.

124
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:52,899
Granted, to you,
five days may seem like an eternity,

125
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,168
seeing as it's roughly five times
as long as any

126
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,073
of your pasty relationships
have lasted,

127
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,947
but trust me,
that hardly makes you an expert.

128
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,643
Really? Because you never
went to ass-face school,

129
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,585
but you seem to be
an expert at that. Am I right?

130
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:08,950
Here's some!

131
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh, dear girl!
You're going to high-five that, Dorothy,

132
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,891
right when you'd managed
to get off of my radar screen?

133
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:18,463
Big mistake. Bi-ig mistake!

134
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,866
I didn't know what I was high-fiving.
I gotta stop doing that!

135
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:25,358
- Did you eat my Mango body butter?
- No.

136
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,405
<i>[J.D.] I schmeared it on focaccia.</i>

137
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,101
Dr. Kelso, what's up?

138
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,815
I just heard that we're doing our
first ever in-house heart transplant.

139
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,717
I know you'll be objective in choosing
which surgical resident assists,

140
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,689
but I also thought you might enjoy this
commemorative Dr. Kelso bobblehead.

141
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,247
Huh?

142
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:50,962
Oh, bobbleheads.

143
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,798
You think you're gonna get bored
with them, but you never do.

144
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,766
Bobbly, bobbly, bobbly, bobbly.

145
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,371
Bobbly, bobbly, bobbly,
bobbly, bobbly, bobbly...

146
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,574
- Sir?
- Oh, Turkelton, you're still here.

147
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,202
- Look what someone gave me.
- Sir, I gave you that.

148
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,880
Did you think you'd be the only surgeon
to walk in here and try to bribe me?

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,440
Inflatable-five.

150
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,725
Actually, none of you
will be assisting on anything

151
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,023
because we still don't have
a donor heart.

152
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,997
Now, last night, Mr. Bolger here
was declared brain-dead.

153
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:29,934
But we have to convince his family
to pull the plug and give us his heart.

154
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:35,040
Whichever one of you Benihana rejects
pulls this off gets the operation.

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,405
Go!

156
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,043
I'm going to call you Ming Lee.

157
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:03,033
My band has decided we're only
singing songs from classic movies now.

158
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:07,000
Ted, I'm a little busy, OK?

159
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,576
And as soon as I spackle this guy's
chest back together, I'm headed home.

160
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:14,204
Also, we're no longer called
the Worthless Peons.

161
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,685
We were sued by a Dutch metal band
with the same name.

162
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,721
- We now go by Foghat.
- Again, Ted, busy. OK?

163
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:28,784
Dr. Reid, what are the possible
cardiac complications to thyrotoxicosis?

164
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,658
[Coughs] Mm... Um...

165
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,867
Hold on.
I just have to blow my nose.

166
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,103
<i>Even though I was happy</i>
<i>for Elliot the endocrinology expert,</i>

167
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:40,594
<i>I still couldn't figure out</i>
<i>how she knew so much.</i>

168

# <i>Just a steel town girl</i>

# <i>Looking for the fight of her life</i>

170
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,281
To answer your question, thyrotoxicosis
can manifest with incessant tachycardia,

171
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:51,839
leading to a cardiomyopathy.

172
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,421
# <i>Locking rhythms</i>

173
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:59,124
# <i>Changing music into light</i>

00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,150
# <i>She has danced into the danger zone</i>

175
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,296
# <i>When the dancer becomes the dance</i>

176
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:08,163
# <i>It can cut you like a knife</i>

177
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,303
# <i>If the gift becomes the fire</i>

178
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:15,406
# <i>On a wire between will</i>
<i>and what will be</i>

179
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:19,968
# <i>She's a maniac, maniac on the floor</i>

180
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:25,078
# <i>And she's dancing</i>

181
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:31,277

00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:43,591
Therefore, Mr. Langley's pancreatitis
is most likely secondary to gallstones.

184
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:48,305
[Gonging]

185
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,511
Wrong-o, Perry! Mr. Langley's
pancreatitis is most likely due

186
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:56,605
to type I familial hyperlipoproteinemia
as demonstrated

187
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,543
by the eruptive xanthomas
on his Achilles tendon.

188
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,484
[Interns] Ooh!

189
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,289
Interns, flee, now. Go!

190
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,257
[Whistles]

191
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,728
Barbie. Now, there is just no way
you could have known that

192
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,424
off the top
of your straw-covered scarecrow head.

193
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:17,101
Hold on, I need to take a quick mental
picture of your total humiliation.

194
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,466
- Got it.
- Barbie...

195
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,607
One more with redeye reduc. [clicking]

196
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,210
There are actually many things
in life that I've yet to figure out,

197
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,906
like why men wear
cell phones on their belt

198
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,518
when they could so easily fit them
in their pocket, mere millimeters away.

199
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:37,682
Or why, and I'm not complaining,
women wear tube tops

200
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,486
even though every ten seconds
they cause them to do this:

201
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,527
[Grunting]

202
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,161
Yes.

203
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,467
But, of all of my endless queries,

204
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,936
the one thing I damn sure
will figure out, and soon,

205
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,706
is how you keep coming up
with all these fancy-pants answers.

206
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,909
It is, for all intents and purposes,
like they're falling from the sky.

207
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,073
Excuse me! Can anybody else
watch this kid for a second?

208
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:15,122
She'll be all right.
I wonder what's taking Jordan so long.

209
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,770
Oh, my God!
It's like 130 degrees in here!

210
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,533
- Oh!
- [Fizzling]

211
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,177
I have got to get out of here!

212
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,872
[Sighs]

213
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,848
Mm.

214
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,686
I think the silicon
in my lips is expanding.

215
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,620
[Groans]

216
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:50,561
I gotta talk to the Bolgers about their
son's heart, but I can't find them.

217
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:54,258
- Oh, they're in the doctors' lounge.
- Oh, my God, Laverne, I love you.

218
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,891
If any other surgeon asks about them,
you send 'em someplace else.

219
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:01,739
The cafeteria, the zoo, I don't care.
I'm going to get my heart!

220
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:05,903
Is there a Bolger in the house?!

221
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,481
We're the Bolgers. Did our son wake up?

222
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,744
Uh, no.

223
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:20,454
<i>OK, the coast is clear. Just a few</i>
<i>more steps and you're outta here.</i>

224
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,122
<i>Home, sweet...</i>

225
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,068
J.D., I need to talk to someone.

226
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,628
- Here, take him.
- What?

227
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,198
- I'm not...
- Come on.

228
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,942
Hey, wait! Come on!
I'm doing lines here!

229
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,275
Attention, drug addicts.
Once again, lines of paint.

230
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,808
- OK? Line of paint.
- [All groan]

231
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:48,847
- I wanna do the paint.
- You wanna do the paint?

232
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,653
- Mm-hm.
- You can't do worse than I did.

233
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,251
Where the hell are all the surgeons?

234
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,692
Hey, kid.
Have you seen the Bolger family?

235
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:06,065
No, but I saw a monkey
playing with himself.

236
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,595
Guys, change in plans. Come on.

237
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:14,245
Anyway, Dr. Reid, our hospital lecture
series is tonight and our psychologist,

238
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:17,510
Dr. Burk, had to cancel his talk
on fear of public speaking.

239
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,353
Why? Because he's afraid
of speaking in public? Yeah.

240
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:26,457
No. His depression finally got
the best of him and he hung himself.

241
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,890
It's very sad.

242
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,132
Anyhoo, we need a speaker and Dr. Cox
suggested you'd be the perfect person

243
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,692
for an intensive Q & A on endocrinology.

244
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,762
Be in the classroom at six.

245
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,474
And Barbie, say, if it's cold in there,
you can just borrow my lab coat.

246
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:47,205
It's super warm
because I lined it with these.

247
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,943
Ta-da!

248
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,680
Listen, I know this is hard to face,

249
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,390
but for all intents and purposes,
your son is gone.

250
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,882
Trust me, donating his heart
so another man can live

251
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:07,565
would be one of the most rewarding
decisions you could ever make.

252
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,931
We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.

253
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:14,172
<i>When a career-making opportunity</i>
<i>is slipping away,</i>

254
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:17,074
<i>even a doctor can succumb</i>
<i>to one of the basest human impulses.</i>

255
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,974
You know, I've donated an organ.

256
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,544
<i>They can lie.</i>

257
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,615
Yeah. See, my buddy, he was sick.

258
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:27,819
He was really, really sick,
and so I gave him one of my kidneys.

259
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,515
But my son has only one heart.

260
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,323
That's true. That's true.

261
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,160
But, you see, a short time after that,
I donated my other kidney.

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,718
Then you'd be dead.

263
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,801
But, Mr. Bolger, if you'd just
let me finish, with all due respect.

264
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:47,567
See, right after the procedure,
I received a new kidney.

265
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:51,442
So a man as healthy-Iooking as you
is living on one donated kidney?

266
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,342
No.

267
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,381
You see, not long after that,

268
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,747
I received my second donated kidney.

269
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,520
Dr. Turk, you're standing here
talking to us

270
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,284
with two kidneys
neither of which is yours?

271
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,189
Oh, no.

272
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,094
I have since donated one of those.

273
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,864
Yeah, you see, Mr. Bolger, Mrs. Bolger,

274
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,594
I've donated three kidneys.

275
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,869
We're gonna check on our son.

276
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,972
J.D., I have to admit this
to somebody: I don't like kids!

277
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:30,470
What? You're the most
maternal person I know.

278
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:34,018
I'm a nurse! I'm trained to fake it.
I don't see what's so adorable.

279
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:36,885
"You made a poopie!"
I'm supposed to be impressed?

280
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,849
There's a monkey
at the zoo who can do that.

281
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,650
When he's not
playing with himself.

282
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,996
If you don't want to have a baby, don't.

283
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,231
But I want to have a child with Turk
more than anything in the world.

284
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,723
It's crazy, but I'm a girl.
That's how we roll. What am I gonna do?

285
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,032
I'm supposed to be the brave one.

286
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:56,238
Dude, you gotta help me out.

287

<i>A hospital can sometimes</i>

293
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,021
- So how was the zoo?
- It was awesome.

294
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,519
They had lions and tigers and bears.
Oh, my!

295
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,682
Dude, it was awful.
I couldn't stop lying to them.

296
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,157
I'm a surgeon. I only have two moves.

297
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,462
If surgery goes well,
the fake modest nod and wink.

298
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:53,692
Now, if surgery goes bad
and the guy dies,

299
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,469
there's always
the head-shake, sad walk-away.

300
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:01,205
Turk, it's my day off.
Toto and I are going home.

301
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,536
Fine!

302
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,610
OK, I'll help.

303
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:13,007
- That your head-shake, sad walk-away?
- Yes, it was.

304
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,778
- It's quite good.
- Thank you.

305
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,955
How do I tell them to let their son go?

306
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,191
Try and imagine
what they're going through.

307
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,593
I think about what it's gonna be like
when you die.

308
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:24,925
You think I'm going first
due to my diabetes.

309
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,160
Right. Where
do we meet up in heaven?

310
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,634
At the milk shake pool
on the lesbian cloud.

311
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,436
That's right. I'll see you there,
player! I love religion.

312
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,700
If someone tried to pull the plug on you

313
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,809
without being honest,
know where they'd end up?

314
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,174
Hell, watching <i>The View.</i>

315
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,913

Ow! Ow! Ow!

Doug! Why are you hitting me?

322
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,337
I thought you were a dead guy,
coming back to life!

323
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:09,273
- Then why were you hitting me?
- Dead people should be dead!

- There you are! Come on.
- No, no!

to be here today! I'm going home!

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,718
That's different
from leaving him with you?

329
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:27,825
- I have freckles.
- Oil can. Oil can!

330
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,760
- Thank you.
- Hey, you. Where's my son?

331
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:36,197
He's playing with the birds
out on the ledge.

332
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,768
- What?!
- I'm kidding!

333
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,305
Come on. He's green.

334
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,763
You idiot. To be continued. Come on.

335
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,807
The little nipper
got ahold of a paint gun

336
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,419
when I was painting this line
to the smokers' lounge.

337
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:58,189
Thanks to him,
I only got halfway down.

338
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:02,421
You look familiar.
You ever play ball in Pennsylvania?

339
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,290
Pepe?

340
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,260
Mr. Bolger, look,
before you throw me out of here...

341
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:26,914
I just want to apologize about earlier.

342
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,619
I don't know what I was thinking.

343
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,157
But rest assured, from here on out,

344
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:35,860
whatever you ask me,
I'll be completely honest with you.

345
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,624
- Really?
- On my life.

346
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,199
Do you shave your head because you like
the way it looks or you're going bald?

347
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,723
Bald.

348
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:48,938
OK, next question.

349
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,575
Those topical treatments...
I wasn't completely functional.

350
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:54,945
Dr. Turk, why are
all the surgical residents

351
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:58,073
being so relentless
about my son's heart?

352
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:01,886
Because whichever one of us
convinces you to pull the plug

353
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:05,656
and donate his heart
gets to assist in the transplant.

354
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:08,819
And that is a huge boost
for any young surgeon's career.

355
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:13,219
You're talking about my son here.

356
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:15,932
And you don't even know him.

357
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,934
What's his name?

358
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,096
Ray.

359
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:25,639
How you doing, Ray?

360
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,101
Now ask me if I think
it's the right thing to do,

361
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,752
even if you request
that I don't assist.

362
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,912
Do you?

363
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,152
Yes.

364
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,226
I do.

365
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,556
I'm really sorry.

366
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:52,491
- You gotta get me outta this.
- Are you with me, Dr. Dorian?

367
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:02,410
Sorry. I'm trying to be careful
about what I high-five.

368
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:06,517
Oh, so you don't think it was
a good thing that slavery was abolished.

369
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,348
Unbelievable.

370
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,122
How would that subject even come up?

371
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:14,420
J.D., there is no way
I'm gonna pull this off!

372
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:17,027
I'm going to have a roomful
of specialists firing questions at me.

373
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,359
I'm gonna be a bigger fraud
than Barry Bonds!

374
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:23,033
<i>You know he's an athlete of some kind.</i>
<i>Just say something general.</i>

375
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:26,525
Still, I love it when Bonds wins
at the game that he plays.

376
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,903
You know how people
become specialists?

377
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:33,244
They obsess about the material
over and over again

378
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,109
until it's lodged in their brains.

379
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,249
That's exactly
what you've been doing. Watch.

380
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,851
Where's the closest page
you've hidden around here?

381
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,685
I knew I felt some Scotch tape
on my treasure trail.

382
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,550
All right, look.

383
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:51,562
What's the leading differential
in an obese woman

384
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,996
suffering from amenorrhea
and hirsutism?

385
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:57,167
Polycystic ovaries.
Oh, my God. I knew it! Up here!

386
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,897
Thought you weren't high-fiving.

387
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,609
Well, with her... We'll talk later.

388
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,076
Dr. Cox?

389
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,245
Pay no attention
to the man behind the curtain.

390
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,720
Why aren't you freaking out?
Look at him.

391
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,192
Your kid's all green and slimy.

392
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:24,795
I suppose it's because,
when Jordan was pregnant,

393
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,263
I mentally prepared myself
for her giving birth

394
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,922
to something green and... slimy.

395
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,536
- Where is Jordan anyway?
- The wicked witch of the east wing?

396
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:36,233
Last I saw, she was trying
to turn the heat down in her office.

397
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:37,997
Help me!

398
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:46,350
Anyone! Help! I'm melting!

399
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,887
Help me! I'm melting... melting...

400
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,218
Oh!

401
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,155
So he's green.
Don't beat yourself up, Carla.

402
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:00,164
Come on. So far, on my watch,
he's gotten stitches,

403
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:03,067
cut his own hair
and eaten over four dollars in change.

404
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,900
Honestly, if I ever need
to feed the parking meter,

405
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:09,264
I just check the diaper, don't I?

406
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:11,904
You don't understand.

407
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,645
I didn't dump him on the janitor
because I was busy.

408
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,273
I dumped him
because he was working my last nerve

409
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:20,117
and I wanted to smush his face.

410
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:22,176
I'm not meant for this.

411
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,255
Carla, look at me and Jordan.
You know how we hate everyone?

412
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:26,722
[Laughs] Yeah.

413
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,561
Well, that goes doubly for children.

414
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,763
It's true. They're loud,
you can't understand them,

415
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,526
they're like tiny cab drivers.

416
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:39,803
But trust me,
when you do have your own kid,

417
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:41,566
you won't feel that way.

418
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,875
Yeah? What'll be different?

419
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,901
He'll be yours.

420
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,143
Sir, I was watching that.

421
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,195
Why don't I just tell you what happened?

422
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:07,464
Philip gets Webster the dog
despite George's objections.

423
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,988
It was good. Now, on your feet.

424
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,369
They need you in the OR
to assist on the heart transplant.

425
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,927
The Bolgers said yes?

426
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,575
They took their son
off life support an hour ago.

427
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,736
Mr. Bolger wanted you to have this.

428
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:24,837
- His son's driver's license?
- Turn it over.

429
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,253
<i>Every so often, a wizard comes along</i>
<i>and tells you what you need to hear.</i>

430
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:32,313
Seems like you had a heart all along.

431
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,889
- Superior vena cava?
- Right.

432
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:41,456
Yes!

433
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,434
See? You had the brains all along.

434
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,698
[Singing <i>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</i>
a cappella]

435
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,299
Trust me, Carla.

436
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:50,707
When you do have your own kid,

437
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,976
you're gonna find you had
the courage to be a parent all along.

438
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:53,943
Thank you.

439
