00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:06,362
[Beeping]

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,833
What is that?

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,171
This is an
electronic hide-and-seek game.

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,610
The other person wears a sensor.
Closer you get, the more it beeps.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,942
- Ah! Funsies.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,382
Mrs. Factor has an aortoenteric fistula
and needs a consult.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,014
[Turk] Fire away.

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,816
- See her red highlights?
- Yes.

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,824
Could I pull those off
or am I so kidding myself?

10
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,656
- I don't have time.
- You're playing hide-and-seek.

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,060
With my nine-year-old patient, Eric.

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,362
He's been in the hospital for a month.
He deserves a little fun.

13
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,164
- Sorry, Turk. Sorry.
- [Beeping]

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,605
- [Rapid beeping]
- Mmm! [laughs]

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,439
How bad would she look
with red highlights?

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,139
I know. It is now my turn to hide.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,305
- I count.
- All right.

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,212
Close a brother up.

19
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,784
So I like to remember
all the carpal bones in the hands

20
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,515
with a simple mnemonic device.

21
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:00,753
Scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform,
trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate.

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,385
Some lovers try positions
that they can't handle.

23
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,589
Hey.

24
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,825
That was not directed at you, doctor.

25
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,300
But you should stretch first
next time you try the Whirly Bird.

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,000
Excuse me, does anyone here
happen to have a plate of jeebies?

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,374
Because these two just gave me
a big old scoop of the heebies.

28
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:23,405
Seriously, it cannot just be me.
I want to hear from the audience.

29
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,679
I do. Dating in the workplace.

30
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,152
She's the boss. He's the pretty intern.

31
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,554
Tell me what's bugging you. Courage.

32
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,057
[Clears throat]

33
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:37,153
Well, sometimes they arrive
in the morning and they smell like sex.

34
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,762
Gloria, telling it like it smells.

35
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,427
I'm proud of you.

36
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,301
Barbie, who hurt you?

37
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,167
Is there something you want?

38
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,403
Actually, yes.

39
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,641
It is one of those rare days
where you could be of use to me.

40
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,148
You speak German,
I have a patient from Berlin

41
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,118
and I need to tell the gentleman
he has fluid in his lungs.

42
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,882
[Speaks German]

43
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,789

46
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,468
[Speaking German]
How are you?

47
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,197
- [Phone rings]
- [Gasps]

48
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,639
Relax, dude.
Playing electronic hide-and-seek.

49
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,836
Hey, baby.

50
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,278
Yeah, I know my shift's over, but...

51
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,475
No, I'm not fooling around
with J.D. I'm...

52
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,382
OK, cool. I'm on my way home.

53
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,920
All right, I just took the pregnancy
test. Just tell me when a minute's up.

54
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,622
I just put some pizza rolls
in the microwave oven.

55
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,927
The minute that bad boy dings,
we're good to go.

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,225
Oh, my God, I can't stand it!
Thirty more seconds!

57
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,271
OK, honey. Don't get too excited.

58
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,603
They have to cool off for a minute.
That cheese is like lava.

59
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,576
Is there a bigger idiot
than you in the entire world?

60
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,510
[Siren wailing]

61
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,180
- I'm seeking you, Turk!
- [Beeping]

62
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,343
[Beeps]

63
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,579
It's negative.

64
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,691
Look at me.

65
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,286
Hey, look at me.

66
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,759
It's gonna happen.

67
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,528
Eat your pizza rolls.
I gotta get to work.

68
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,607
By the way, next time,
buy a name brand pregnancy test,

69
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,411
- not that generic one.
- If you raised my allowance,

70
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,043
I wouldn't have to bargain shop
to buy pizza rolls.

71
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,613
Secondly, this pregnancy test works
just as well as the name brand one.

72
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,362
Wait a second. Results in three minutes.

73
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,524
<i>[J.D.] Some things deserve</i>
<i>to be tossed out on their asses.</i>

[Speaking German]

75
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,802
<i>[J.D.] But the thing</i>
<i>you shouldn't toss out</i>

76
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,640
<i>is a pregnancy test that takes</i>
<i>two minutes longer than you thought.</i>

77
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,279
Oh, my God, we're pregnant.

78
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,691
[Screaming]

79
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,125
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

80

# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

81
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,869
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,198
Mr. Roberts and I just love
our above-ground pool.

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,837
In high school,
I was actually all-state swimmer.

84
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,211
Breaststroke-five! Maybe later.

85
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,151
<i>[J.D.] Every workplace has that guy</i>
<i>who has to top everyone else's story.</i>

86
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,951
When I was 19,
I was a world-class 110-meter hurdler.

87
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,821
<i>[Janitor] I remember the nationals</i>
<i>like they were yesterday.</i>

88
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,755
[Man] Runners, take your positions.

89
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,966
On your mark...

90
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,204
...set...

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,011
[cheering, applause]

92
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,553
Good race.

93
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,621
They offered me
a full ride at Grambling,

94
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,858
but I slept
with the president's daughter.

95
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,059
Not the college president.
The president of the United States.

96
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,468
But if Amy Carter asks you up
for a nightcap, you do not say no.

97
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,406
No. No more.

98
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,706
Here are some of the lies
you've told over the last five years.

99
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:50,044
You went to Harvard. You have a wife
who only has a pointer and thumb pinkie.

100
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,244
You have a brother-dad,
a mother-sister.

101
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,150
You have two kids.
Wait, one kid.

102
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,088
You had a baby with a Chinese local.
You're deaf-mute.

103
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,648
Wait. You're a world-class hurdler

104
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:05,221
and you slept with the beautiful
and irreplaceable Amy Carter.

105
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,428
I didn't sleep with Amy Carter.
We did everything but.

106
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,562
- Oh...
- I really was a world-class hurdler.

107
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,503
We're not buying it. Are we, gang?

108
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,338
- No.
- Yeah, no.

109
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,642
The people have spoken.
Allow me to bask in the glow.

110
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,580
- J.D., guess what?
- Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking.

111
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,119
Dude, listen to me!

112
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,354
[Whooping]

113
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,493
Where is Carla?

114
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,688
She just went downstairs.
What is all the excitement?

115
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,495
You tell him. No, you tell him.

116
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,795
We're having a baby.

117
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,770
Red states be damned.
You're gonna make great fathers.

118
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,096
- What's going on?
- My turn.

119
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,438
- OK. Go ahead.
- Carla? Prego!

120
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,447
[High-pitched] Oh, my God, Turk.
Carla must be so happy.

121
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,244
I haven't told her. I'm gonna now.

122
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,944
Wait, Turk. When has
a man ever been able

123
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,510
to tell his wife that she's pregnant?

124
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,285
Allow me to paint you a picture
with my imagination brush. OK?

125
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:10,261
You two come out in the parking lot
where Carla's friends have gathered.

126
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:16,290
They're holding a banner that says,
"Carla, you're pregnant and I dove you."

127
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,563
Did I say "dove"? I did, Turk.

128
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:23,802
That's when I cue the bird wrangler who
releases 500 white doves into the air.

129
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,368
Where do they land? I don't know.
But one thing Carla knows

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,816
is that in her uterus
is a little, soft baby Turk.

131
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,613
Are you forgetting what happened

132
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,052
when you had doves
at my parents' anniversary?

133
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,613
This won't be indoors and there
won't be people throwing birdseed.

134
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,660
Why were people throwing seed?

135
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:46,096
The point is you, my friend, have
a chance to be on the greatest surprise

136
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,963
a husband has ever pulled for his wife,

137
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,198
and you get credit for it
the length of your entire marriage.

138
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,533
- I'm in!
- Great.

139
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,632
I'll tell everybody.
You find Carla. Dr. Cox...

140
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,576
Halt. I will be doing nothing.

141
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,011
Well, you at least
won't tell Carla, right?

142
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,518
Ever since I was blitzkrieged
by an enraged German named Otto,

143
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,884
a certain Dr. Barbie
no longer exists for me,

144
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,116
so if she was to ask me a question,

145
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,920
I wouldn't be able to hear
and you'd have to repeat it.

146
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,258
- Can you just please not tell Carla?
- Fine.

147
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,299
And Elliot, if you see Carla,
don't get emotional.

148
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,764
Oh! No problem.

149
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,166
Really? Baby.

150
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,901
[High-pitched] Oh, my God, Turk.
Carla's gonna be so happy.

151
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:35,871
The family wants me to do a hip surgery.
What are they thinking? The guy's 92.

152
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,508
He's their grandfather.
It's not like he's a dog

153
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,849
and they can go to a kennel
and pick out another one.

154
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,054
We just got a lot
of great new grandfathers in.

155
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,098
OK. Ooh! Look at this one. He's so cute!

156
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,259
Hey! Get out of my yard.

157
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,893
He's not good with people.

158
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,339
He's great, but we really
don't want to separate them.

159
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,433
I already have a grandma.

160
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,675
If I get one this little,
everybody's gonna think I'm gay.

161
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:13,543
Oh, look at this fellow. Come here, boy.

162
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,350
Got a little hard candy for you.

163
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,085
Come here. Yes. Good boy.

164
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,426
Who's a good boy? You got a candy
you can unwrap in a movie theater.

165
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,467
I'd name him Sebastian.

166
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,595
Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He
seems a little more lurky than usual.

167
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,039
I pissed him off earlier today.
How am I supposed to avoid him?

168
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:40,875
Put the hide-and-seek sensor on him.
That way you'll always know where he is.

169
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:46,010
It would take a very clever plan to hide
this tiny penny-like sensor on him.

170
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,788
Five bucks if you eat this penny.

171
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,120
Done... and done.

172
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,185
We pulled it off. See if it works.

173
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,127
[Beeping]

174
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:03,498
My friend, we have
just LoJacked the Janitor. Hello?

175
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,500
I've got a patient with osteomyelitis
who needs a bone biopsy.

176
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,574
Who do you use?

177
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,906
You've put me in an awkward spot
because I'm a healer and I want to help,

178
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,642
but speaking to you would acknowledge
your existence. You don't exist.

179
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,083
So I'm going to address the stapler.

180
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,245
Hi, stapler. The red is killer.

181
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:27,657
By the way, there's a Dr. Brownsfield
who is just the most wonderful bone guy.

182
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:33,222
What? What's that, stapler? Oh, no.
She... She's an actual doctor.

183
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,062
Neither of you are very funny.

184
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,657
Here are your lab results.

185
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,261
[High-pitched] Oh, my God, Carla.

186
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,501
- Elliot, what's wrong?
- Yeah, Elliot, honey. What's wrong?

187
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:47,341
Nothing,
I'm just very emotional because, um...

188
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,578
...Keith dumped me. I have to go.

189
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,946
Another one. Shoot.

190
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,855
Keith, I have been watching you
and you've got some potential.

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,485
You do, but can I
give you one piece of advice?

192
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,895
- Please.
- It is all about confidence.

193
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:11,062
Hell, be a cocky bastard.
Throw 'em a wink every once in a while.

194
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,867
Show me a wink. Show me the wink.
Give me the wink.

195
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,508
That's the guy. That's the guy
who broke our friend's heart.

196
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,580
- Well, hey. He's probably hurting too.
- Mmm...

197
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,215
Hey, baby.

198
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,649
Oh, no. He did not just wink at me. For
the next five minutes, I am not a nurse.

199
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,780
Carla, Carla. There is a better way.

200
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,226
I don't like it, but Jordan tells
her friends intimate details about me.

201
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,059
Our sex lives, parenting deficiencies.

202
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:43,795
The point is I'm sure Elliot
has told you things about Keith.

203
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,396
So instead of yelling at him,
why not calmly let him know

204
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,840
that you know things
that he thinks no one knows.

205
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,076
Oh, Keith, mind taking a walk with me?

206
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,114
Yeah.

207
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,983
- Is Carla gone?
- Yeah. She sure is.

208
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,580
- Oh, thank God.
- Say Barbie? We're even.

209
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,916
Oh, no.

210
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,926
All right. Before Carla arrives,

211
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,955
I want to thank you all for turning out.
Especially you, Father Rosenberg.

212
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,763
Incidentally, when this is over,

213
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,203
I'd love to get the back story
on that name of yours, OK?

214
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,433
- [Beeping]
- Excuse me.

215
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,740
[Beeping]

216
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,712
OK. Coming through.

217
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:34,151
Now, apparently they don't
have fetus balloons. Who knew?

218
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,222
What I've done
is attached string to the bellybuttons

219
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,123
on these baby balloons
to signify the umbilical cord.

220
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,354
Make sure everybody gets one.

221
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:48,024
Keith, you seem to have missed the
point here. We're not really broken up.

222
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,695
I can't believe you told Carla I made
out with my sister in sixth grade.

223
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,399
I don't understand
why you're so embarrassed.

224
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,442
I've met Denise. She's gorgeous.

225
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:02,378
You might not get pregnant
for a very, very, very long time.

226
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,077
I know it's gonna happen. You know
what I'm looking forward to the most?

227
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,119
What's that?

228
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:11,781
When we go to our friends and I can
tell them one-by-one, "I'm pregnant!"

229
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,917
I can't wait to see the look
on each one of their faces.

230
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,462
I think about it every day.

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,466
Anyone tries to take those moments
away from me, I'll kill them.

232
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,095
Me too. Just need to send a quick text.

233
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Oh, no. We've got a glitch.

234
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,171
Abort the plan!
Abort the surprise!

235
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,713
Abort the babies!

236
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,544
Everybody, run!

237
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,392
Sorry about the whole
"abort the babies" thing.

238
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,829
Actually, I'm pro-choice.

239
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,039
<i>[J.D.] Knowing someone's pregnant</i>
<i>when they don't know it</i>

240
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,607
<i>can get a bit complicated.</i>

241
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,441
Let me take that from you.
You left the fridge open.

242
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,506
- I spilled it.
- I'll get another one.

243
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,914
Sorry.

244
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,985
What are you doing?

245
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,180
I may have gotten over-excited
and told her family members

246
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,748
- that she's pregnant.
<i>- [Machine] You have 59 messages.</i>

247
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,316
<i>[Woman] Carla...</i>

248
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,453
[Carla] The answering machine's broken.

249
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,021
And I don't think
we have any more wine.

250
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,794
Turk, can I have some of yours?

251
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,837
<i>[J.D.] I felt Turk was starting</i>
<i>to blame me for all this.</i>

252
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,902
I spilled mine too.
You know what you should do?

253
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,103
Ask for some of J.D.'s.

254
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,182
Spilled mine too.

255
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm going to bed.

256
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,212
What are you gonna do?

257
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,053
I'm gonna tell her the truth and hope
she's so tired from being pregnant,

258
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,786
she doesn't have
the strength to kick my ass.

259
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,021
Wait, Turk. I have an idea.

260
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,031
You have another idea, huh? I gotta
tell you I'm done with your ideas.

261
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,864
And not just now, but forever.
OK? Are we clear on that?

262
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,030
- It's a good 'un.
- I'm listening.

263
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,242
We need Carla to find out she's pregnant
on her own and we need help.

264
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,278
- Can we count on you?
- Absolutely not.

265
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,040
- No way.
- Who's pregnant?

266
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,877
We go down, we're taking you.

267
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,950
- What?
- Why?

268
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,486
Would somebody
please tell me who's pregnant?

269
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,714
- Carla.
- Another kid? My God!

270
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,484
- How many does that make?
- This is her first one.

271
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,289
- If you say so, son.
- You can't blackmail us.

272
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:35,493
Really? Because I think you're both
very close to Carla, aren't you?

273
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,263
And yet you chose not
to tell her she was pregnant.

274
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,964
How would that go down for 'em?

275
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,497
- Unpleasantly.
- Unpleasantly.

276
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,475
They've got you two by the short ones.

277
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,569
It's true you didn't know anything,

278
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,581
but I'm willing to bet these guys
would swear that you did.

279
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,344
- Definitely.
- I'd enjoy it.

280
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,682
- Well played, Turkelton.
- Thank you.

281
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:59,315
OK. Listen up. Everyone in the
hospital knows Carla's pregnant.

282
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,859
But they don't know she doesn't know.

283
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,091
We need her to find out on her own
before anyone congratulates her. OK?

284
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,225
Here's the plan. The three of us
are gonna run interference.

285
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,260
Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, I need you to get
her to take another pregnancy test.

286
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,806
This plan is foolproof.

287
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,433
That's impossible. You two are involved.

288
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,171
Yeah, we'll see about that.

289
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,805
- You go left.
- OK. That was right, buddy.

290
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,439
I need to come with you.

291
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,018
Where's Carla?

292
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,020
Uh, she went up
to the roof to get some air.

293
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,716
Oh.

294
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,525
- Follow her. Lock her up there.
- You got it.

295
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,564
[Beeping]

296
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:44,728
Hello, Janitor hiding around
the corner waiting to grab me.

297
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,168
How'd you know that was me?

298
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,139
I'm holding a GPS warning device
that goes off

299
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,540
whenever you come
within 100 meters of me.

300
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,976
It's responding
to a sensor in your stomach.

301
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,947
- I knew that wasn't a penny.
- You'll never get near me.

302
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,109
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we will see.

303
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,153
- We're gonna see.
- The only thing left to do? See.

304
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,984
- You're gonna pay.
- We'll see.

305
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,785
- No time.
- OK, bye.

306
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,221
Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso. Look who I've got.

307
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,164
Hey, Carla. You're glowing.

308
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,861
Really?

309
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,426
Have your breasts gotten bigger?

310
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,565
Whoa! Dr. Kelso, that is inappropriate.

311
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:27,010
Baby, that sounds like a compliment to
me. Maybe you're just a little hormonal.

312
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,243
Well done, Bob. A little direct,

313
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,082
but I definitely think we put
the idea of pregnancy in her head.

314
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,247
Is that what we were doing?
I was just making conversation.

315
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,656
- I have been a little moody.
- Yes, you have been.

316
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,217
This morning I was nauseous,

317
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,560
but I thought it was pizza rolls
I had for breakfast. I like them.

318
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,997
We can get them from now on.

319
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,629
Still, Turk, do you think I should
go home and take another pregnancy test?

320
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,331
It's your call, baby.

321
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,840
Hey! Somebody get me down from here!

322
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,777
- What's she yelling?
- I don't know.

323
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,338
I'll have someone
from Psych check her out.

324
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,013
Dr. Dorian,
I got those batteries you asked for.

325
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,048
<i>[J.D.] I was anxious because it was</i>
<i>time to change Mr. Beeper's batteries.</i>

326
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:19,063
<i>All clear to the left,</i>
<i>all clear to the right. You can do this.</i>

327
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,761
He's 100 meters away and it's gonna
take ten seconds to change batteries.

328
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,100
That's not even a world-record pace.

329
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,501
Ready... set... go!

330
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,389

341
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,884
- Hey, J.D.

342
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,518
- We have such big news.
- What's the scoop?

343
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,064

What do you mean,
when Turk first told you?

348
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,341
Oh, boy.

349
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,540
We've known for a day.

350
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,346
The pregnancy test
you took yesterday was positive.

351
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,752
Yeah. I wanted to have everybody
at the hospital gather outside

- Mm-hm.
