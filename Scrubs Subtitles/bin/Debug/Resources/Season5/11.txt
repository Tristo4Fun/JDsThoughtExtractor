00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,704
Yes, J.D., I will do this with you.

169
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,682
Oh, Dr. Kelso.

170
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,843
Where... Where's your wife going?

171
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,787
He's gonna ask Dr. Kelso if we can get
some equipment for women in the gym.

172
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,724
- Oh. That is so nice.
- My baby's learning.

173
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,758
[Turk] Oh!

174
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,766
Are you crazy?

175
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,564
Why would you want your wife
in the gym?

176
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,367
Because unlike you,
I don't hate my wife.

177
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,702
Yet. You don't hate your wife yet.

178
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,938
But think about it, huh?

179
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,482
You go to work, she's there.
You go out, she's there.

180
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,575
And when you go home, where is she?

181
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,683
- There?
- Ding.

182
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,782
Women are everywhere.
Except for the gym.

183
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,894
That's why it's such a magical place.
Don't ruin that. Don't be that guy.

184
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,592
Come on.
You're so much more than that.

185
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,796
[Whispering] I'm begging you.

186
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,504
I'm... I'm actually
saving that for someone.

187
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,634
- That's not allowed.
- Fair enough.

188
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,680
Say, that's a real nice pantsuit
you have there.

189
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,114
Oh, well, thank you.
It's 40 percent off.

190
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,551
Swing by my place and see
if we can't get it 100 percent off?

191
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,616
Had to be done.

192
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,482
- Thanks. I got your next one.
- Don't mention it.

193
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,791
I'm late 'cause Dorian parked
his scooter behind my new van.

194
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,697
Practically punctured a tire backing
over it. Kid drives me crazy.

195
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,927
A new van, huh?

196
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,560
You blew up the old one over a bet.
Remember?

197
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,935
Right.

198
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:44,238
Dorian drives me crazy too.
But what are you going to do about it?

199
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,348
I stole this from his locker.

200
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,443
I come by here a couple times a week
and move stuff around.

201
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,183
Turn off his alarm.
Maybe cut his bangs.

202
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,556
You're in need of help, but darn it,
I'm not gonna give it to ya.

203
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,163
How sound a sleeper you think he is?

204
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,200
Well, watch this.

205
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,529
Why?

206
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,764
So, what now?

207
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,805
- [Siren wailing]
- [Screaming]

208
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,411
Naked. Excellent.

209
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,910
Who took my emerald?

210
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,146
<i>[J.D.] After paying the Janitor</i>
<i>the unreasonable sum of $90</i>

211
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,483
<i>to move my bed back home...</i>

212
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,824
<i>... we decided to round up our interns</i>

213
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,831
<i>so we could pick out</i>
<i>our respective booty calls.</i>

214
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,265
<i>Welcome to Fuglyville.</i>

215
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,798
J.D., I don't want to do this.

216
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,567
Can't we just go home and put on
our pj's and watch <i>Grey's Anatomy?</i>

217
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,472
Oh, I do love that show.

218
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,377
It's like they've been watching
our lives and then just put it on TV.

219
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,210
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

220
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,516
<i>[J.D.] Carla listened at the door while</i>
<i>I was helped Turk ask for gym equipment.</i>

221
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,258
- What do you want?
<i>- [J.D.] And then Turk lied.</i>

222
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,919
Sir, we're here on behalf
of Dr. Bianca.

223
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,429
You know, the albino radiologist?

224
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,729
Oh, Jim!

225
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,564
Who'd he get pregnant this time?

226
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:22,005
I tell you, the ladies cannot
resist that ivory rascal.

227
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,841
Sir, Jim is demanding that he
gets new equipment in his lab.

228
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,846
Demanding?

229
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:35,879
There is no way in hell
that Jim is getting new equipment!

230
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,215
Sorry, baby. I tried.

231
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,562
- Has there been any change?
- She's still the same.

232
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,540
<i>[J.D.] I guess in the back of my mind</i>
<i>I was hoping for a pleasant surprise</i>

233
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,169
<i>because around here</i>
<i>most of them are unpleasant.</i>

234
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,542
[Sighs]

235
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,777
<i>Like when a guy you thought</i>
<i>you connected with turns on you.</i>

236
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,819
Hey. How's the day
treating you, big guy?

237
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,415
You're not talking to me,
are you, Doogie?

238
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,547
Doogie?

239
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,492
This is a doctor no-fly zone, bubs.
Speaking of flys, yours is down.

240
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:20,024
Oh, no!
You fell for the grade school zinger!

241
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,761
You gotta go!
Back to the game, boys.

242
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,274
And you guys would not believe
how hard my man fought for us.

243
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:35,109
Yeah. Well, you know, ladies,
I do what I do when I do what I do.

244
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,444
<i>[J.D.] Or your boss blows your cover.</i>

245
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,007
Turkelton,
I have reconsidered your request

246
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,545
and I've decided to give old Jim
that new MRI machine.

247
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,750
[Yelps] See, baby... No! Wait!

248
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,192
<i>[J.D.] My surprise</i>
<i>came the next morning</i>

249
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,628
<i>when I found out Elliot</i>
<i>had broken our no booty call agreement.</i>

250
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,993
<i>With my nemesis.</i>

251
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,039
Why is he wearing my robe?

252
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,065
It fits me.

253
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:13,040
- J.D., I can explain.
- Oh, you did it twice.

254
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,679
All righty. Somebody's a stud.
We got a stud alert in here!

255
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,121
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

256
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:25,496
OK, this is just mathematically
impossible.

257
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,465
Keith, Dr. Dorian and I
have to get to work now, OK?

258
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,298
Why don't you clean this up,
then drop off my laundry

259
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,737
and get me a coffee and bring it
to the hospital. Run, like a bunny.

260
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,603
Sure thing, Elliot.

261
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,577
Keith! It's after nine.
It's Dr. Reid now.

262
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,746
Dr. Reid. Dr. Reid.

263
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,511
I love booty calls.

264
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,485
"El Toro Grande"?

265
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,988
I'm not familiar with this brand.

266
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:59,423
No change.
Her FIO2 is still 50 percent.

267
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,359
I said no cream.

268
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,199
I didn't say no cream.
It's like having a sex puppy.

269
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,130
- What's your problem?
- I can't stand that guy.

270
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,301
J.D., he's just a booty call.

271
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,404
- Say the word and I'll end it.
- I'd appreciate it if you'd end it.

272
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,314
Oh, my God. You've turned Keith
into forbidden fruit.

273
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,483
I must have him now.

274
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,114
Heel! [clicking tongue]

275
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,351
Oh. Hey, bud.
Check out my new mop bling.

276
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,918
Bling!

277
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,361
It's cool. I cleaned it.

278
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,625
Oh, so what?
Now we're pals again?

279
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,497
I've got to be honest.
I'm confused, Sasquatch.

280
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,628
I got a rep to protect, OK?

281
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,730
I'm seen as the king of working folks.

282
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,469
If they catch me hobnobbing
with a doctor-type,

283
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,001
I won't get my cut of prosthetics
we looted from the storage room.

284
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,413
- How's that?
- We sell feet to college kids for $500.

285
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,816
Apparently, they...
smoke something out of them.

286
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,254
Let me get this straight.
You are embarrassed to be seen with me?

287
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,483
At the hospital.

288
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,788
At the bar we can hang out all we want.

289
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,622
You rich, yacht-owning punk!
You think...

290
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,291
They're gone. It's cool.
See you at the bar.

291
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,265
Aw, sweetie,

292
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:17,105
do you want me to call his mommy
and tell her he's being mean to you?

293
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,145
My friend is mean to me.

294
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,512
Listen. Honey, I know you're angry.

295
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,051
But look what I found in my locker.
A wad of cash.

296
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,178
You can buy the shoes you wanted.

297
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,917
I'm not mad about that gym thing.
Sign this please.

298
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,253
- Any of you ladies have a pen?
- Whoo!

299
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,426
Oh! Yow!

300
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,728
- Yow!
- [Sighs]

301
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,825
You set me up.

302
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:44,869
Baby, you are mad.

303
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,701
It's not a crime for me to want one
place that I can hang out by myself.

304
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,709
Turk, I am not mad, OK?

305
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,938
Now staple these, please.

306
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,208
Anybody got a stapler?

307
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,249
Hey!

308
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,453
Hey.

309
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,584
<i>[J.D.] I promised I wouldn't pick</i>
<i>on Keith, but this one he had coming.</i>

310
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,628
OK, guys.
Gather round, gather round.

311
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,788
Your hero, Keith here,

312
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,698
forgot to check the blood levels
on Mr. Joy this morning

313
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,826
and guess what?

314
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,465
He's dead.

315
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,597
Way to go there, Keith.

316
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,573
I've never seen this guy before.

317
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,941
Oh! Way to get to know
your patients there, murderer.

318
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,139
There's Mr. Joy.

319
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,478
J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?

320
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,917
I left a note on the decapitated guy's
stump I'd have him back by 2.

321
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,248
It is 1:45.

322
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,848
I have to take him back to the basement
and I don't even have my gurney.

323
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,825
I hate dead people.

324
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,328
All right. The real reason
that I brought Mr. Joy up here

325
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,662
was for a teaching exercise.

326
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,760
Can anyone figure out
the cause of death?

327
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,169
Maybe when you leaned over
to check his I.V.,

328
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,333
you smothered him to death
with one of your love handles.

329
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,205
What did you say, Keith?

330
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,113
Dr. Reid told me if you picked on me
I should stand up for myself.

331
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,017
And that you're very sensitive
about your... doughy physique.

332
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,816
Well, I'm not.

333
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,156
Please, no one help.
He's not heavy at all.

334
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,597
Out of professional decorum

335
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,431
we should refrain
from talking about Dr. Reid.

336
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,201
He's boinking her, everyone.
That's why he gets special treatment.

337
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,572
What did she say to do
if I said that?

338
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,703
- Page her.
- Ah!

339
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,680
- Hello.
- [Gagging]

340
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,815
I forgot how strong you are
when you're mad.

341
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,017
Hey, can I...
can I talk to you for a sec?

342
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,654
What's the matter, Sally?
Vending machine's out of bras again?

343
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,458
Nice. You tell him.

344
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,658
What's up, buddy?

345
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,294
I just thought your friends might
be interested in seeing this photo

346
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,339
I took with my cell phone
the other night.

347
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,808
I'm going to airbrush
"Friends Forever."

348
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,938
Then I'm gonna hang these bad boys
all over the hospital.

349
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,982
Oh, evocative.

350
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,449
- Give it to me.
- You want it? Come and get it.

351
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,453
- Come and get it.
- Gentlemen,

352
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,989
let's try to be professional.

353
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,289
I left my gurney downstairs
in the morgue.

354
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,295
You're a superstar.

355
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,558
One of them staplers
could've killed me.

356
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,965
Know what bothers me?
You whining about me being in your space

357
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,901
when you never want to be alone.

358
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,531
For God's sake,
you bought side-by-side toilets.

359
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,940
- That was a surprise for your birthday.
- A surprise for me.

360
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,310
- Surprise! How about that? OK?
- I don't want it. Take it back.

361
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,641
Doughy physique, Elliot?
Doughy physique?

362
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,948
If the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it.

363
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,318
I am ashamed of you, OK?

364
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,358
Do you know how petty it is
to get that personal?

365
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,393
- My own face, OK?
- That's what I'm telling you.

366
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,726
Once when we were dating,
Elliot asked me to urinate on her.

367
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,163
[All stop arguing]

368
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,801
I had been stung by a jellyfish!

369
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,337
[All arguing]

370
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,405
<i>[Pagers beeping]</i>

371
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,783
<i>[J.D.] Around here, it can feel</i>
<i>like good things never happen.</i>

372
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,749
Good to see you, you old bird.

373
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,356
Did I miss anything?

374
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,493
I'll catch you up later.

375
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,258
<i>[J.D.] Of course, when they do,</i>

376
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,358
<i>all the petty little arguments</i>
<i>fade away.</i>

377
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,898
<i>And you don't mind waiting</i>
<i>a little longer for your workout.</i>

378
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:48,306
<i>Or your bar friend</i>
<i>not being your work friend.</i>

379
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,406
<i>Because the truth is,</i>
<i>when you put stuff in perspective,</i>

380
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,849
<i>the little things</i>
<i>will never bother you again.</i>

381
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,579
Good morning, Dr. D.

382
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,385
Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass
out of the shower and make an omelet.

383
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,425
You want one?

384
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,959
<i>[J.D.] Did I say never?</i>
