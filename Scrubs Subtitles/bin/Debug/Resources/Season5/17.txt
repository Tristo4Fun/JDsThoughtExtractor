Oh, no, no. I know I've got the hair,
but I'm not one of you, uh, people.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,655
Hello. How are you?
Well, I have been known to tambour.

- Morning, Dr. Dorian.
- Praise be to Krishna!

# <i>They call me mellow yellow</i> #

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,472
Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis
is doing a number on your liver.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,813
You're obviously very jaundiced...

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,548
Yellow! Oh, "mellow yellow,"
I get it! That's funny.

18
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,922
I never knew what that song was about.
Now I finally get it. Liver disease.

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,291
We're gonna give you
suppressive therapy

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,230
and do everything we can to make sure
you don't need a liver transplant, OK?

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,927
- OK.
- All right. We'll see you, Mr. Coleman.

22
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,130
<i>[J.D.] Unfortunately, a month later...</i>

23
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,040
- Let's hear it.
- Frank, we have no more options.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,078
We gotta get you a new liver.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,020
So how's the boy toy thing going?

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,922
I'm thinking of trading Perry in
for a younger model.

27
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,925
We're getting kind of serious...

28
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,861
Excuse me, I need a moment of silence
so I can get into a meditative state

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,399
where I block out
any irritating white noise.

30
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,300
I call it my happy place.

31
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:50,575
- You know, it's kind of rude...
- [waves breaking, seagulls cawing]

32
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,009
- I understand you...
- Sweets, he can't hear you.

33
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,140
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

34
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:02,217

That has been eating at me
for two years. Anyway...

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,094
Keith is great.
The only problem is his last name.

38
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:14,498
- It's, um... Dudemeister.
- Oh, that doesn't even sound real.

39
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,435
It's German, Dudemeister.
It means "master of dudes."

40
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,474
One of the reasons I divorced Perry
was his last name.

41
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,307
- You don't like Cox?
- Actually, I love Cox.

42
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,346
Greatest conversation ever.

43
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,382
- See, that's the problem.
- [Woman] This sausage is huge!

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,613
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm needed elsewhere.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,689
The four of us should go out
for a drink sometime.

46
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,281
- We're free tonight.
- It's a couple date.

47
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,519
Done!

[Waves breaking, crashing]

49
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,865
Something horrible just happened.

50
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,760

Is this thing on? Jell-O?

56
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,189

You know that.

62
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,063
- I didn't get that one.
- Me neither.

63
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,769
If you ever donated a body part to me,
you know which one I'd want?

64
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,474
Thanks for the butt, player!

65
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,709
You better have a reason
for taking my man's badonkadonkdonk.

66
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,081
I do, Carla. I'm building something.

I need you to run interference for me.
Keep people from seeing me vulnerable.

115

So you think I'll automatically do this?

116
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,711
You think my ego is so big

117
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,878
that I'll be flattered
that I'm the only one you open up to?

118

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,422
- Can I get a better hands-free headset?
- No.

167
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,515
Am I allowed back
in the men's locker room?

168
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,650
No!

169
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,888
- Can I get some new work boots?
- No.

170
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,458
Guess the old ones work.
I do have more requests.

171
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,264
I need an anvil, barbed wire
and a bow and arrow.

172
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,997
- How about a sled dog?
- No.

173
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,038
- Cowboy hat?
- No.

174
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,606
- Javelin? Ferris wheel?
- No.

175
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,641
- Stun gun?
- No.

176
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,437
- Pelican.
- No!

177
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,204
I'll be on the couch napping.

178
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,746
Sweetie, calm down.

179
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,184
If you're miserable,
you can talk to me, OK?

180
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,722
I won't abandon you, all right?

181
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,757
OK.

182
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,385
- My God! I love your necklace!
- I got it from the Indians in the park.

183
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,929
Let's go to the bathroom,
you can try it on.

184
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,599
Hey, uh, Dr. Cox, can you get me a beer?
I forgot my ID.

185
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,194
Oh.

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,336
I can't believe people
hang out at bowling alleys.

187
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,277
It's great.
Surround yourself with new friends,

188
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:44,009
you say one clever thing,
and you're in. Watch this.

189
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,415
You guys, let's tally it up.
Gather around.

190
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,251
Whoa, Carol! 180! Amazing.

191
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,757
Lisa, you had a 125.

192
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,794
- Turk, 192.
- That's how we do.

193
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,295
And I bowled a gentleman's 40.

194
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,424
Now, who wants to
help me off with my shoes?

195
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,661
I forgot to wear socks.

196
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,462
I'm losing them.

197
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,906
If you ladies remain in this area,
we'll bring back drinks.

198
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,308
- Nice save.
- Thank you.

199
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,470
[Gasps]

200
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,175
- [J.D.] Krishnas.
- Relax, they'll never recognize you.

201
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,137
Good to see you again.

202
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,763
What's up?

203
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,648
I hate it when Keith wears that shirt.

204
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,186
We get it. You like sports.

205
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,314
Sweetie, you have to dress your man.

206
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,088
For God's sake, Perry walked out
of the house tonight in a hockey jersey.

207
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:07,929
- Dr. Cox, when you first...
- [waves breaking, seagulls cawing]

208
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,797
Hey, you. Make an effort.

209
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,042
You may tell me who your favorite
sports team is. Keep it short.

210
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,737
- Detroit Red Wings.
- Oh.

211
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,884
For the next 20 minutes,
you will sit in silence

212
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,112
while I tell you why
the Detroit Red Wings

213
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,213
are the greatest franchise
in the history of sports.

214
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,054
On September 25, 1926...

215
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,755
Look at you, man!

216
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,729
Your color's back.
There's no sign of infection.

217
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,924
I feel great.

218
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,160
- You look great, man. I'm glad.
- Thanks.

<i>[J.D.] Unfortunately, things</i>
<i>weren't going as well for Marc.</i>

220
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,608
He's hypotensive and tachycardic.

221
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,775

224
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,978
Christopher, why haven't you
finished your case reports?

225
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:06,013
Sorry, I was gonna do them last night,
but I wound up going out with my buddy.

226
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,752
Just get them done.

227

<i>[J.D.] Or going out with an intern</i>

for coffee. Want to come?

229

[Stammering] Get the hell away from me.

230
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,702
Why are you all smiling?

231
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,141
Keith said you'd be mean,
but then you'd tell us sports stories.

232
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,273
Oh, my God!

233
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,881

Prep the O.R.

238
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,597
Can I have the crash cart in here?

239
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,230

[Alarm sounding]

241
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,676
One of the sutures came undone,
but we got it in time.

242
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,912
- He should be fine now.
- Nurse, call me if there's any change.

243
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,477
- How awesome was last night?
- You got bowled by my frat brothers.

244
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,684
We're cool. They invited me
to this alumni thing in January.

245
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,125
- The Martin Luther King Fling?
- Sounds hot.

246
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,358
We're going out Thursday, right?
I got a Magic Eight Ball bowling ball.

247
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,401
Check it. Are the ladies
gonna love this?

248
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,097
"Ask again later"?
I'm just kidding. It says yes.

249
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,108
- Thursday night might not work.
- You're going. Where are the interns?

250
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,942
They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently,
he's mentoring and talking to them.

251
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,070
<i>[J.D.] What?!</i>

252
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,240
OK, that's it!

253
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,778
This right here is the "get hit" line.
Cross it at your own risk.

254
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,882
When do you turn nice?
This is getting kind of old.

255
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,517
Never, Leslie.

256
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,652
- He knows my name!
- [Cox whistles]

257
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,959
I was calling you
by a random girl's name.

258
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,397
Listen, please.

259
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,060
I don't care about
any of your problems.

260
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,105
I have no answers for any of you.

261
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:05,007
But my boyfriend is bi-curious
and he wants me to pick his lovers.

262
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,469
I might have an answer for that.

263
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,070
Ew!

264
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,513
I mean, come on, children.

265
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,346
What do you actually think
is going to happen here?

266
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:19,324
Do you think I'm going to take you
and sit you down next to me and say, um,

267
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,920
"Listen, uh, if you need anything,
you've got my pager.

268
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,262
Just know that
I'm there for you always"?

269
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,201
Oh, my God.

270
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,932
- Newbie!
- No! Zip it!

271
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,498
I am so G-darn pissed right now.

272
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,136
I was OK when you kept me
at an arm's length,

273
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,613
because everybody said,
"That's Cox. That's how he operates."

274
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,479
And I believed them.

275
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,815
But now I walk in on this...

276
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,256

I hate to do it,

278
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,057
but I'm giving you back the pencil.
That's right.

279
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,063
The pencil you gave me
on my third day of work.

280
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,397
You handed it off to me
like a tiny yellow baton,

281
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,200
like you were trying to say to me,
"J.D., you are the new me.

282
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,208
You, J.D., are my mentee.

283
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,643
You... are my son."

284
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,778
What pencil?

285
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,478
Oh, that's perfect.

286
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,010
That's perfect.

287
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,055
You know what? Take it.

00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:28,492

289
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,359

290
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,555

292
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,393
His name is Leslie.

All right. Good for you, Leslie!

295
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,314

332
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,471
Let's do this.

333
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,931
Let's do it.

334
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,274
I like this particular outfit

335
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,107
because it's casual

336
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,445
and the pant pockets are extra-deep,
which is perfect for storing makeup.

337
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,382
He's like a giant purse.

338
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,843
This shirt is itchy.

339
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,890
Oh, oh. Shh. Purses don't talk.

340
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,154
Jordan, you promised
this would never happen.

341
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,125
[Gasps]

342
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,566
How dare you?

343
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,601
- Could we talk?
- One sec.

344
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,974
I just wanted to thank you
for the other night.

345
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,913
Since Perry and I had Jack, we don't
get to go out that much as a couple,

346
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,282
and it was really nice.

347
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,813
- Don't tell anyone I'm nice.
- Oh, mm, no. Mm-mm.

348
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,716
Dr. Kelso, we need to talk.

349
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,421
Baxter was a good dog.

350
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,597
You never think you're gonna
miss animals as much as you do.

351
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,964
It was just nice having some creature
in my life who never disappointed me,

352
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,133
never judged me,

353
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,235
never showed up late
at my 50th birthday party

354
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:12,181
with freshly pierced nipples and a
barely legal Filipino boy named Pogo,

355
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,811
- my son Harrison.
- I figured.

356
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,879
Man's best friend, huh?

357
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,155
They got that one right.

358
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,388
At least you've stopped crying.

359
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,589
No, not really.

360
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,226
My body can't produce tears anymore.
I've intentionally dehydrated myself.

361
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,826
It's a risky move, I know,

362
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,429
but Dr. Jarvis here
said it'll be all right.

363
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,667
There's nobody standing behind you.

364
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,673
I'm going to need an IV.

365
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,048
J.D., can I talk to you?

366
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,277
I can't right now.
I gotta check on Frank.

367
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,550
So are you missing
the other half of your liver?

368
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,151
Oh, I'm not, but my gallbladder's
pretty broken up about it.

369
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,162
Apparently they had a thing.

370
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,098
You've got a gift, man, a gift!

371
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,466
Did your brother freak out
when you told him you almost died?

372
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,267
I didn't tell Frank.

373
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,734
Look at him. He's so happy.

374
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,174
If he knew what I went through,
he'd feel terrible.

375
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,012
Why would I wanna do that to him
when I love him so much?

376
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,419
Hey, Turk.
You wanted to talk to me?

377
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,049
- You wanted to talk to me?
- You wanted to talk to me?

378
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,093
[# Bobby Bare, Jr: <i>I'll Be Around]</i>

379
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:37,257
Dr. Cox, can we talk about something
besides sports this time?

380
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,394
You're OK.

381
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,528
OK, there, Keith,

382
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,541
you may choose between good Scotch,
ab workouts or Lee Marvin movies.

383
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,635
- And who over here needs a refill?
- Yes, please.

384
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,045
- Thanks for the 'tini, Carla.
- You got it, mama.

385
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,208
- Here you go, Grumpy.
- Latin Grammys!

386
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,218
- Tell you the nominees.
<i>- Fabuloso.</i>

387
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,516
- Category?
- Reggaeton.

388
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,184
- Having a great time, man.
- Me too, me too.

389
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,727
Cheers.
