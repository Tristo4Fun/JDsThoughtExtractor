1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>[J.D.] Today started off on a high note.</i>
<i>Ernie, the homeless guy,</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,301
<i>shattered the record</i>
<i>for the most blood donations in a month.</i>

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,866
Whoo!

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,071
Congratulations, Ernie.

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,444
Nineteen pints!

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,616
- He probably needs a little more juice.
- Yes.

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,712
<i>[J.D.] Even though we were</i>
<i>sending Ernie upstairs</i>

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,122
<i>to most likely get some</i>
<i>of his own blood back,</i>

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,887
<i>I couldn't help but smile.</i>

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,589
<i>Today, Dr. Cox was</i>
<i>returning back to work</i>

11
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,393
<i>after the accidental death</i>
<i>of three of his patients.</i>

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,627
<i>OK, there he is.</i>
<i>Just play it cool.</i>

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,398
What is the latest
on Mrs. Riley up in 403?

14
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,770
Mrs. Riley was admitted
with shortness of breath

15
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,741
and then she developed a...

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,904
<i>[J.D.] Stay cool. Stay cool.</i>

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,140
<i>Aw, screw it!</i>

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,583
You sent those demons right back
to hell, didn't you? Straight to hell!

19
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:56,382
OK, here's a bud
clearly in need of nipping.

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,084
Newbie, there are some things
that, if they happen,

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,184
we do want to make
a big deal out of them,

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,559
a cure for cancer,
teaching dogs to talk,

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,860
and you walking past the food cart

24
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,492
without referring to cream cheese
as "cow fudge."

25
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,865
I like to play with words.

26
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,305
However, of all the things there
are to make a big deal out of,

27
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,672
can my return to this hellhole please,

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,371
please, please not be one of them?

29
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,311
Well, sure thing, Perry.

30
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,110
But, uh, there is one problem.

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>[All]</i> # <i>Welcome back</i>

32
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,823
# <i>Your dreams were your ticket out</i>

33
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,826
# <i>Welcome back</i>

34
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,591
# <i>To that same old place</i>
<i>that you laughed about</i>

35
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,168
# <i>Well, the names have all changed</i>
<i>since you hung around</i>

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,070
# <i>And them dreams have remained</i>
<i>since you turned around</i>

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,698
J.D.!

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,675
That's when the background comes in.

39
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,702
# <i>Who'd have thought they'd lead you?</i>
<i>Who'd have thought they'd lead you?</i> #

40
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,305
That's a run I was gonna do,
but now is awkward.

41
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,078
It's unbelievable.

42
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,853
<i>[J.D.] Since Dr. Cox was back, I decided</i>
<i>to knock out all my errands extra quick.</i>

43
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,293
<i>And what better way to get started than</i>
<i>with my new 18-wheeler scooter horn?</i>

44
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,659
<i>- [Horn honking]</i>
<i>- [People screaming]</i>

45
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,403
<i>First, I grabbed a quick lunch.</i>

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,340
<i>Then I returned some e-mails.</i>

47
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,040
<i>- [Brakes squealing]</i>
<i>- [Truck horn honking]</i>

48
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,244
<i>Finally, a shortcut through</i>
<i>the mall parking lot,</i>

49
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,979
<i>which meant dealing with the skate rats</i>
<i>and their famous ring o' fire.</i>

50
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,354
[J.D.] Ring of fire!

51
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,086
Whoo-hoo!

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,718
Top that, dude!

53
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,192
Sasha!

54
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,207
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

55
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,403
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

56
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,742
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,450
<i>[J.D.] With Sasha</i>
<i>back in the scooter shop,</i>

58
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,651
<i>I decided to buy a bike</i>
<i>and get some exercise.</i>

59
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,422
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>what happened to my old bike.</i>

60
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,225
<i>Ow.</i>

61
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,858
- Nice helmet.
- Actually, it's not a helmet,

62
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,196
it's a hair-met.

63
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,635
See, it's got extra room built in
so you don't mess up your hairdo.

64
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,301
I'm gonna go ahead and write you
a prescription for two testicles.

65
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,208
You get it filled whenever.

66
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,007
<i>[J.D.] That's weird. It felt like</i>
<i>that had happened before.</i>

67
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,142
<i>When you work at a hospital five years,</i>

68
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,744
<i>situations are bound</i>
<i>to repeat themselves.</i>

69
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,346
You know, doctor, I'm getting tired
of your sexual innuendo.

70
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,188
In your end-o.

71
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,160
Dr. Kelso, it's so cold in Pediatrics,
the kids are wearing mittens.

72
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,234
Hey, champ, what has two
thumbs and doesn't give a crap?

73
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,769
Bob Kelso. How you doing?

74
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,835
<i>That's what déjà vu is,</i>

75
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,342
<i>feeling like you've lived</i>
<i>the same moments a thousand times.</i>

76
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,635
<i>Whether it's Turk's tepid response</i>
<i>to the baby stuff Carla makes him do...</i>

77
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,342
Friday, we meet the baby-proofer
at the apartment.

78
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,111
Oh, I can't wait!

79
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,847
<i>... or Dr. Cox giving</i>
<i>Elliot a hard time...</i>

80
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,981
Barbie, why did you order
this test? For the love of God,

81
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:22,323
are you a real doctor
or a doctor like Dr Pepper's a doctor?

82
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,224
<i>Or the Janitor having</i>
<i>menace in his eyes.</i>

83
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,560
That looks like trouble.

84
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,399
Hey, come here a sec.
We want to do stuff to you.

85
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,962
<i>OK, just distract them before</i>
<i>they do what they've got planned.</i>

86
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,639
- We were thinking...
- I got a riddle for you.

87
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,680
- This isn't how you said it would go.
- Troy. We're listening.

88
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,582
Two coins add up to 30 cents,
and one of them is not a nickel.

89
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,212
I think I've heard this before.
What are they?

90
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,949
It's a riddle.
You figure it out.

91
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,888
Troy, get your hat.

92
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,725
We're going to the bank.

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,260
Look who's back, Mrs. Goldstein.
It's Dr. Cox.

94
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,430
How was Acapulco?

95
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,667
We told everyone
you were in Acapulco.

96
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,971
I never went to Acapulco,
Mrs. Goldstein.

97
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,138
I lost three patients and spent
the last two weeks on my couch

98
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,876
trying to drink myself to death so that
my victims and I could be reunited

99
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,113
in the afterlife and they could
rightly have their vengeance.

100
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,711
I realized that that tactic
would never work,

101
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,749
as I'd be sent straight to hell,
which, I imagine is a lot like Acapulco,

102
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,456
only there'd be fewer Latin men
trying to sell me Chiclets on the beach.

103
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,294
All the best.

104
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,028
Is there a reason
you're still near me?

105
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,765
We covered Mrs. Goldstein while you
were gone, but she's your patient.

106
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,809
Her BP's dropping. It might
be time to push thrombolytics.

107
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,844
Yeah, but she could bleed out.

108
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,346
I suppose you could wait
and see how she does.

109
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,938
Then she could decompensate.

110
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,985
Well, those are the two options,
so what are you gonna do?

111
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,181
I'll be right back.

112
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,652
Did you guys just see that?

113
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,522
Dr. Cox had to make a decision,
he completely froze.

114
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,154
He's probably just
thinking it over, Elliot.

115
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,495
He never used to think things over.
He made gut calls right away.

116
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,864
Listen, Reid,

117
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,029
normally any damage
to Dr. Cox's oversized ego

118
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,869
would be cause for celebration.
Yet, for some reason,

119
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm not wearing a party hat, sitting
bare-ass on the hospital copier machine.

120
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,742
You know why? It's not because
I have "Johnny" tattooed on my butt.

121
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,376
He was a Navy buddy. If you went
through what we did, you'd understand.

122
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,750
<i>[J.D.] Again with the déjà vu.</i>

123
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,551
It's because
your little theory is way off.

124
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,525
If you don't want to be there
for him, it's your decision.

125
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,221
But I'm going to be.

126
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,291
J.D. Robs the ball!
Black guy open!

127
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,834
[Hissing]

128
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,504
No ball in the hall.

129
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,069
[Both] Sorry, Leonard.

130
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,303
I wouldn't be mad
if that was the first time.

131
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,107
They come three to a can.
Why you playing basketball?

132
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,341
I thought you had
to have lunch with Carla.

133
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,385
She's taking a pregnancy nap
so I get to do whatever I want.

134
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,013
I'm telling you, J.D.,
Carla being pregnant is awesome for me.

135
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,825
<i>[Turk] I get to watch whatever I want</i>
<i>while she reads her pregnancy book.</i>

136
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,861
<i>- I get to eat all the good food.</i>
- Echhh.

137
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,139
<i>And, of course, ring of fire.</i>

138
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,177
Ring of fire!

139
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,939
[Cheering]

140
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,174
<i>[Turk] Bottom line, pregnancy's awesome!</i>

141
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,450
OK, two coins, equals 30 cents,
no nickels.

142
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,523
I could swear we've done this before.

143
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,558
You went to Yale for God's sake!

144
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,560
Relax. I figured it out.

145
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,186
A penny...

146
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,265
and... a button

147
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,265
that you wrote "29 cents" on.

148
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,359
You think I don't
recognize your handwriting?

149
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,562
Can't we just kill him?

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,835
How's therapy going?

151
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,712
- Dr. Cox, do you have a second?
- Of course.

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,680
- I was wondering...
- You're done.

153
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,048
- What?
- You asked for a second.

154
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,885
I think you'll find I'm being quite
literal here at work today. Ask anyone.

155
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,255
Lonnie, what happened earlier
when you said, "Give me a break"?

156
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,852
You broke my sunglasses in half.

157
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,695
Had to be done. The man
looked preposterous in aviators.

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,260
You still haven't made a decision
about how to treat Mrs. Goldstein.

159
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,636
Oh, thanks for the reminder, Barboo.

160
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,572
What would I do without you?

161
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,408
Look, joke if you want to, but
you're gonna have to make a decision.

162
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,879
Mrs. Goldstein's life depends on it.

163
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,647
But what if I'm wrong?

164
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,918
All right. She'll have a ginger ale,

165
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,427
he'll have a beer,
and I'll have an appletini.

166
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,463
Hell, I'm gonna have a real drink.

167
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,193
- Make it a nectarini.
- I don't know what that is.

168
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,361
Oh, come on, Kevin.
You know. Make it.

169
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:02,465
Make sure I don't have too many
nectarinis. I gotta drive my bike home.

170
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,841
Don't worry about it. Carla can't drink.
She'll drive you home.

171
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,880
- Right, baby?
- Sure.

172
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,709
- Sweet.
- Better idea,

173
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,410
come over to our place,
she's going straight to bed.

174
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,251
- We'll stay up late, watch <i>Judge Dredd.</i>
- Ninety-ninth viewing!

175
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,351
OK, ice cold beer, nectarini

176
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,121
and ginger ale.

177
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,895
There's nothing better in this world

178
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,728
than the first sip of
an ice cold beer after a long day.

179
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,561
Ditto for a 'tini.

180
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,469
- It really takes the edge off.
- That's it.

181
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,063
No beer for you. It's not fair.

182
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,201
I'm here pregnant, you two
are having the time of your lives.

183
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,438
From now on, if I can't do it
you can't do it.

184
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,481
- Carla, that's ridiculous!
- Not you!

185
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,311
Fair is fair, Turk.

186
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,613
Incidentally, dynamite nectarini.

187
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,620
That man knows his way around nectar.

188
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,086
I used to just look into
my gut and know what to do.

189
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,322
Now I got all this self-doubt.

190
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,558
Barbie, you got
massive amounts of doubt,

191
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,194
romantically, professionally,
personally. How do you deal with it?

192
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,434
Treadmill, crank the incline up
to 15 and just run through the tears.

193
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,105
Look, Dr. Cox,
I know that you're scared,

194
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,671
but, believe me,
your gut is still there.

195
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,877
You just have to have
the courage to listen to it again.

196
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,715
You really think so?

197
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,345
I know so.

198
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,717
Push thrombolytics.

199
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,820
Thank you, Barbie.

200
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,331
I'm just glad you let me help.

201
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,061
<i>[J.D.] There's no better feeling</i>
<i>than helping someone out.</i>

202
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,605
Laverne, Dr. Cox made a decision.

203
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,368
He wants to push thrombolytics.

204
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,467
Yeah, I know.
He told me that three hours ago.

205
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,171
What?

206
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,211
<i>Maybe that's why it hurts that much more</i>
<i>when you end up looking like a fool.</i>

207
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,049
This is why the headache
didn't go away.

208
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,085
It's actually pronounced analgesic,
not anal-gesic, all right?

209
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,857
The pills go in your mouth.

210
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,834
Elliot, do you ever get
déjà vu around here?

211
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,632
Barbie, there you are. Thank God.

212
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,468
Unfortunately, yes.

213
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:19,067
As you know, I can't make a decision
without your help, so here goes.

214
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,911
On <i>Oprah,</i> there's a story about
Lindsay Lohan's eating disorder,

215
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,577
but on <i>E!</i> there's a story about Lindsay
Lohan's fabulous new Tribeca loft.

216
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,020
Don't get me wrong, I want to watch
something about Lindsay Lohan.

217
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,115
I'm just a little lost here.

218
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,891
FYI, that loft is Lohan-tastic.
It's vintage Lindsay.

219
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,056
When you walked away
from Mrs. Goldstein

220
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,396
anyone could've thought
you were in trouble.

221
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,403
I had to go the bathroom, Barbie.

222
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,768
[Whistles]

223
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,799
People, from now on, if anyone needs
to take a leak, please notify Dr. Reid.

224
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,038
It is a pet peeve of hers.

225
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,611
[Mocking] "As it is a pet peeve."

226
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,949
- Oh, really? You think that's funny?
- A little bit.

227
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,115
- Carla, Turk's drinking coffee.
- No!

228
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,649
If your pregnant wife can't
have coffee, then you can't.

229
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,329
Please have some sort of nut.

230
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,364
[Inhales]

231
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,727
Hazel.

232
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,359
Careful, Turkelton.
First, it's no coffee.

233
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,994
Next thing, she'll want you
in the delivery room,

234
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,006
holding her hands while she pushes
the little bugger out.

235
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,305
My man will be there
when his baby is born.

236
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,278
Of course he will.
It's a different generation.

237
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,452
Know this, 90 percent of all childbirths
are accompanied by an accidental dookie.

238
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,885
Dude, I'd be a mess if I had to give up
my joe. I have a full-blown addiction.

239
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,519
Hopefully, that won't
come back to haunt me.

240
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,597
Where did you get this?
Who taught you how to use this thing?

241
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,074
You, all right?
I learned from watching you!

242
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,513
Damn it, Billy!

243
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,043
At least he's using good beans.

244
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,915
Guess I'm gonna look like
a porn star when I'm older.

245
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,219
Hey, we solved your stupid game.

246
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,759
Yeah, we've been to the li-bary!

247
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,319
"Brary," Troy. Library.

248
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,230
Two coins that equal 30 cents,
one of them not a nickel?

249
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,133
A penny and...

250
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,299
...a 1972 dime with a Roosevelt
imperfection, today worth exactly...

251
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,137
...twenty-nine cents.

252
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,771
OK, no.

253
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,712
The correct answer is
a quarter and a nickel.

254
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,545
No, 'cause you said
one of them isn't a nickel.

255
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,085
Right. The other one is.

256
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,281
You lied to me.

257
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,687
It's a riddle.

258
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,327
Oh, your face is red
like a straw-brary.

259
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,590
Don't have kids.

260
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,700
Excuse me, Dr. Reid. I just wanted
to let you know I'm going to pee.

261
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,146
What a jackass.

262
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,682
I hate it that you two
aren't getting along.

263
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,513
I'd get you together to talk,
but you're stubborn.

264
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,519
I'd never be able
to do it on my own.

265
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,852
Well, there is one way.

266
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,289
I don't want to hear
Floating Head Doctor.

267
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,589
Elliot, save it. He's gone.

268
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,463
Fine, fine, fine.
I will apologize to Elliot.

269
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,899
I don't know how
you'll get her to talk to me.

270
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,403
Oh, don't you worry about that.

271
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,735
Body! Get her!

272
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,709
Get a good night's sleep.
Hey, put me down!

273
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,042
I'm talking to a patient here!

274
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,776
[EIliot] What are you doing? Oh!

275
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,754
Well, she's dead.

276
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,822
Stupid, stupid body!

277
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,431
Oh, you want some of this?

278
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,965
Too slow!

279
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,000
A little late!

280
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,932
Oh, nice try.

281
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,699
J.D., don't worry about it.
I'll handle it.

282
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,677
[Sighing]

283
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,237
- Head fight body again?
- They can't get along.

284
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,873
I don't get it.

285
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,178
Turk, what are you doing?

286
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,018
- You can't ride the bike.
- Why not?

287
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,149
It puts too much pressure
on my cervix.

288
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,992
Baby, I don't have a damn cervix!
And how else am I supposed to exercise?

289
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,190
You can do everything that I do.

290
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:38,032
You can have yogurt, you can listen
to classical music, gently rub my belly.

291
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,128
You know what?

292
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,070
That's it.

293
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,472
What's it?

294
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,271
What do you think you're doing?

295
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,936
You better not open that.

296
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,879
You better not... OK,

297
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,417
but you better not drink it.

298
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,485
Fine, but you better not enjoy it.

299
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,014
Ahh!

300
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,324
Did you just bitch-slap my beer?

301
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,261
Are you calling me a bitch?

302
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,698
Yes.

303
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,498
Yes, I am.

304
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,038
Baby, you OK?

305
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,131
I feel funny.

306
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,640
You know,
I've been thinking about it

307
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,685
and only you could go through
all that stuff you did

308
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,983
and come out the other side
the same mean-spirited jerk.

309
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,684
Barbie, please. They're about
to show Lindsay's breakfast nook.

310
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,250
In fact, in the five years
that I've been here,

311
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,161
you're the only person
who hasn't changed one bit.

312
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,325
Well, that's not entirely true.
Since the arrival of my son,

313
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,130
I think I've become more patient.

314
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,263
Plus, I can't believe these words
are coming out of my mouth,

315
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,799
I've learned that not all of Newbie's
ideas are completely ridiculous.

316
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,107
Do you love it as much as I do?

317
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,174
Well, with me, you've never been
anything but an unsupportive bastard,

318
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,913
and you know it.

319
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,761
You have it on the chart he called me a
bitch because he wanted to drink, right?

320
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,490
I don't really have
a section for that.

321
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,728
Well, put it under family history,
it's part of ours now.

322
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,998
All you had was a little round
ligament pain. It's common.

323
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,973
I'll meet you outside.

324
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,407
Babe, I'm sorry.

325
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,173
You know what?
This was actually kind of nice.

326
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,682
How was this nice?

327
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,776
You being here with me,
all concerned.

328
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,290
It feels like since I got pregnant,
everything's changing for me,

329
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,326
but nothing is changing for you.

330
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,953
So yes, you can drink.

331
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,793
Just maybe not do it in front of me?

332
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,064
And sometimes, when I'm reading
my pregnancy book,

333
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,004
maybe you can ask me about it?

334
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,704
And occasionally, on a Friday night,
when I'm too tired to go out,

335
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,475
maybe you can stay in
and get fat with me.

336
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,045
I can get fat?

337
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,484
The bigger you get,
the tinier I'll look.

338
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,351
- Oh.
- Come on, come on, please.

339
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,463
How's Mrs. Goldstein doing?

340
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,963
Fine.

341
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,257
OK, lookit.

342
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,734
How's about we act like adults here
and lay our cards on the table?

343
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,932
You know you're not exactly
my favorite person in this dump.

344
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,943
And I say that knowing full well
you feel the same way about me.

345
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:37,573
I started an "I hate Cox" chat room.
Hasn't worked out the way I planned.

346
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,618
It's me, two interns
and 14,000 lesbians.

347
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,849
How about we just agree that
we're never gonna be that close?

348
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,720
We could, except for one thing.

349
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,556
I know we have our issues,
but I always respected you.

350
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,324
And you haven't given me more than
an ounce of that since I started here.

351
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,169
I didn't go in that bathroom
to take a leak.

352
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,402
I went in because I was petrified

353
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,206
that I was gonna make
the wrong decision about Mrs. Goldstein.

354
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,770
I didn't want anybody to know,

355
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:14,012
because it is so very important to me
people see me the way they used to.

356
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,582
Bulletproof.

357
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,655
And hopefully, admitting this
to you will make you feel...

358
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,692
...respected.

359
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,127
It does.

360
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,332
Thanks.

361
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,163
You're welcome.

362
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,606
[# The Weepies:
<i>The World Spins Madly On</i>]

363
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,238
<i>[J.D.] It's understandable</i>
<i>why I've been feeling so much déjà vu.</i>

364
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,682
<i>After five years,</i>

365
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,312
<i>it's hard not to feel like you're</i>
<i>repeating moments week after week.</i>

366
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,153
Gotta run. They're doing
a breast reduction on three,

367
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,854
and I want to get up there and stop it.
You know what I'm talking about!

368
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,453
Son, do you not realize

369
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,988
that you're nothing but
a large pair of scrubs to me?

370
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,331
<i>[J.D.] So I guess</i>
<i>all you can do is try to notice</i>

371
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,928
<i>the subtle differences</i>
<i>within those moments.</i>

372
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,231
<i>Whether it's Turk's response</i>
<i>to the baby stuff Carla makes him do...</i>

373
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,279
Friday, we meet with
the baby-proofer at the apartment.

374
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,040
I can't wait.

375
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,715
<i>... or it not bothering Elliot</i>
<i>when Dr. Cox gives her a hard time.</i>

376
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,312
Barbie, why did you order this test?

377
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,550
For the love of God,
are you a real doctor

378
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,753
or a doctor like
Julius Erving is a doctor?

379
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,056
[EIliot laughing]

380
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,759
<i>Of course, sometimes, things are gonna</i>
<i>repeat themselves in the exact same way.</i>

381
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,903
What the hell?

382
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,908
It's a riddle. Two guys destroyed your
bike with a softball bat and a crowbar.

383
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,810
One of them wasn't me.

384
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,283
Oh, that's what happened
to my old bike.

385
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,682
Ha!

386
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,379
- Good day, fellas.
- See you tomorrow.

387
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,552
Troy! This one's over.
