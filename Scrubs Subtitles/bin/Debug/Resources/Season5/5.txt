Fine, let him go to church.
I let him go to magic shows.

I'll tell him it's a lie

That's interesting.

Ah-ah, b-b-but, mm-mmm.

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,344
From now on, cervical mucus
will be referred to as "icky sticky."

170

- Icky sticky.
- Continue.

171

- Morning, sunshine.
- Never say that again.

That was quite a fight
you had with your sister.

175

across from Temple Oheb Shalom at 4pm?

Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by.

179

it looks like the steroid is working.

180

that would be medicine one, God zero.

had a baby with a local.

195

Just the regular stuff.

196
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,101

- Oh, no. We're having sex.

- Wait, baby, I'm too full.

Long story short,
after confirming it with my bunkmates,

209
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,658
that counselor and his "friendship"
lotion were transferred out of our cabin

210
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,058

to put on these gloves.

And the attic upstairs has a lot
of fiberglass in it, so a little hat.

- Sure, bud.

You should wait to see

You're actually encouraging him

Please, Perry, don't hold back.

327
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,888
It's not the God stuff.

328
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:24,020
I've worked hard to try to forget
everything about our childhood.

329
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,155
But when I see you,

330
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,995
I... I can't think about anything else.

331
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,399
It's hard for me too.

332
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't see why you can't be there
for the major events in Jack's life.

333
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,966
I'd love to see him turn three.

334
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,706
The major events, Paige:

335
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,615
His graduation, his wedding, his
divorce and his funeral. The big four.

336
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,245
I beat you at Horse,
he has a church wedding.

337
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,787
Done.

338
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:58,022
- That went in, didn't it?
- Did you thank the G-man for that?

339
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:02,123
- That was all me, baby.
- Yeah, it was.

340
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,503
<i>So maybe relationships can be fixed.</i>

341
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,405
<i>Whether it's by coming around</i>
<i>to your spouse's way of thinking...</i>

342
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:14,241
I'm sorry. I didn't get how
this baby-making stuff could be sexy,

343
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,076
but I do now.

344
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,876
Well, you know, Turk,

345
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,851
I can get angry
if you give me a little help.

346
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,255
If you had no hair,
you'd look like Danny DeVito.

347
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,589
Oh, Turk, a little help.

348
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,127
Mm-hm.

349
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,423
<i>... or by reassuring the Kwans</i>
<i>that their big guy didn't desert them.</i>

350
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,428
<i>In the end, you just have to be willing</i>
<i>to take the first step.</i>

351
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,374
By the way, if you want, Jack's birthday
is in the spring... sometime.

352
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,106
March 21 st. Bye, Perry.

353
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,580
Bye, Paige.

354
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:58,318
- You know, Paige is a silly name.
- Perry's worse.
