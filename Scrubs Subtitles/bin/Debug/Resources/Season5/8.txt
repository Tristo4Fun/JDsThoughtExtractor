I'm a little upset.

He was attached to that thing.

22

He used to wear a bracelet,
"Sasha forever."

23
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,536

and I only wore it for one week.

24

We kissed. I've been
treating his kid for a week now

53
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,460

"Hi, I'm Dr. Reid."
"Why is there blood in my son's stool?"

another patient, Mr. Sutton.

So, Mr. Sutton,
when you came in with heartburn,

111
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,080
I bet you thought
I'd kick your butt out of here.

112
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,143
But not this guy. I admitted you and
stayed up all night studying your EKG

113
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,722
because I had a hunch...
and no girlfriend.

114
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,280
But mostly it was the hunch.

115
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,056
And that hunch paid off because,
if I hadn't found that blocked artery,

116
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,687
you'd be dead right now.

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,406

Oh, gosh, Carla, I would.
I really would.

00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,709
There'd probably be some kinks
to work out initially.

171
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,844
Where is that whore?

172
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,518
- Who's a whore?
- That'd be me, sir.

173
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,150
Oh, of course.
Would you care to elaborate?

174
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,185
See, yesterday, I went shoe shopping...

175
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,026
<i>Shoe shopping.</i>

176
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,963
<i>Shoe shopping.</i>

177
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,559
<i>[All] Shoe shopping.</i>

178
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,365
[Cox] Oh, please.

179
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,374
Jordan used to use that one on me
all the time. Immune. Watch this.

180
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,500
Satin panties.

181
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,540
Fine. I was checking on Mrs. Wilk and...

182
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,479
Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted
to explain to you my behavior before.

183
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,555
It's not like I was making out
with some random guy.

184
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:54,422
I wouldn't do that. Well, I did that
once. There was this Medi-Vac pilot.

185
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,893
Actually, he just
turned out to be an orderly

186
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,124
who got his hands
on a helicopter helmet.

187
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:04,601
But this is different. Sure, it
could get complicated. He has a son...

188
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,363
And a wife.

189
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,310
I've been making out
with a married man

190
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,038
while his sick child
slept a few feet away.

191
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,305
Oh, my God, I've become my mother.

192
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,022
Hi. You said your wife was dead.

193
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,027
I said she wasn't with us.
Don't make me out to be a bad guy.

194
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,528
Well, you're not a good guy.

195
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,088
Good guys don't lie about being single
or about helicopter pilots.

196
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,863
If you were a good guy, you would get
in there and tell her what happened.

197
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,098
- You're right.
- Hell, yeah, I am.

198
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,772
Wait, what?

199
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,570
<i>[Elliot] You know how when something</i>
<i>horrible happens, like a car accident,</i>

200
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,173
<i>everything slows down?</i>

201
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,219
[Gasping]

202
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,617
No!

203
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,284
Whore!

204
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,965
Where is that whore?

205
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,437
Hey, guys. What's up?

206
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,034
Would you do me a favor
and cover Mr. Foster for me?

207
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,080
I have to go to Mr. Sutton's
and get the thank-you I deserve.

208
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,342
You are so obsessing about this.

209
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,908
Like the time you
were convinced the cafeteria

210
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,012
was giving you small waffles.
How'd that work out for you?

211
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,751
They waffle-ironed my foot.
This is different.

212
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,793
- Look, I need a ride.
- Pass.

213
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,921
Oh, pass, huh? Well, this is what
happened last time you passed.

214
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,462
[Both gasp]

215
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,767
OK, put the foot away.
Put the waffle foot away.

216
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,336
This is where Sutton lives, right?
Let's get in there.

217
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,836
J. D...

218
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,113
Dude?

219
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,624
[Growling]

220
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,193
OK, just back away slowly.

221
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,797
Oh, no! Turk, they're organized!

222
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,136
- [Growling]
- Run!

223
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,937
[Stomach growl]

224
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,172
Good Lord, Bobbo, was that your stomach?

225
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,909
<i>[J.D.] And there it was. Hope.</i>

226
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,441
<i>Dr. Kelso's inability</i>
<i>to deal with hunger was legendary.</i>

227
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,579
<i>We were as good as home.</i>

228
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,091
I've heard enough.
Let's call it and go to lunch.

229
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,355
Just hold on.
That is not the way it works, Bobbo.

230
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,365
This is important.
You sit back down and get on with it.

231
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,765
Perry, I'm in charge here.

232
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,599
Ted, give him your sandwich.

233
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,901
I suppose I could spare a small corner.

234
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,769
Everyone just stay right where you are

235
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,803
and we will be back in... two minutes.

236
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,288
<i>[J. D] One sandwich later,</i>
<i>we got back into it.</i>

237
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,122
And then what happened, Dr. Dorian?

238
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,359
Well, sir, fortunately for us,
ostriches are flightless birds.

239
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,994
[Growling]

240
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,968
There goes the sentry.

241
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,403
Every three minutes, like clockwork.

242
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,237
Dude, can I admit something to you?

243
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,777
I kind of missed
not getting my hug today.

244
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,608
Here comes your vanilla bear.

245
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,409
J.D. J.D. Oh, J.D.!

246
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,315
- Whoa-oh-oh!
- Oh!

247
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,254
Dude, don't sweat it!

248
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,619
It says here that the ostrich
is generally a docile creature.

249
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,659
Thank God.

250
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,388
It also says their kick can kill a man.

251
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,191
What? I'm coming back up!

252
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,232
[Growls]

253
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,231
- Turk!
- [Growls]

254
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,563
- [Thud]
- [J.D. Screams]

255
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,436
Mr. Sutton,
I hope this isn't a bad time.

256
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,472
Who cares about Mr. Sutton?

257
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,984
So, Dr. Reid,
you were covering Mr. Foster.

258
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,613
Actually, sir,
I was on my way to cover Mr. Foster,

259
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,249
but then I stopped
in Mrs. Wilk's room and...

260
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,025
- What are you doing?
- Don't look at me.

261
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,628
Do you see
the woman standing outside?

262
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,303
- Yeah, I see her.
- I made out with her husband.

263
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,136
That's disgusting.

264
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,972
OK, just get out of here
and do PFTs on Mr. Foster.

265
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,849
Dr. Reid, why are you hiding?
You didn't do anything wrong.

266
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,855
If we all win this lottery then I am
using that money to find a decent man.

267
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,688
- [Beeping]
- [Man] You may kiss the bride.

268
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,867
Whoa, save it for tonight, big guy.

269
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,771
<i>Mazeltov.</i>

270
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,771
Why did I make him Jewish?
My parents will kill me.

271
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,076
Why ostriches?

272
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,708
They're majestic creatures,
don't you think?

273
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,082
And they're kinda like my children.

274
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,986
Plus, I make belts out of their necks.

275
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,581
Look, Mr. Sutton,
you're wondering why I'm here.

276
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,820
[Turk screams]

277
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,657
- There is a door.
- Man.

278
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,458
You OK?
Did you try and escape?

279
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,591
I did escape.
There was one waiting in the car.

280
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,397
That's Leon. Loves the car rides.

281
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,768
Likes to stick his head out the window.
I tell him it's dangerous.

282
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,897
He doesn't listen.

283
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,909
Mr. Sutton,
I cured you and you never thanked me.

284
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,741
Why thank you for doing your job?
I'm a garbage man.

285
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,110
How times a day
do you think I get thanked?

286
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,151
- Six.
- You're off by about six.

287
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,378
Twelve!

288
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,716
I'm starting
to see why Leon outfoxed you.

289
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,848
Stupid bird stole my hat.

290
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:03,691
I don't see why it's such a big deal
for you to say, "Hey, doc..."

291
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,458
- Why'd he just walk away like that?
- [Mumbles]

292
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,692
[Growls]

293
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,692
Ruh-roh.

294
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,030
Don't move.

295
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,539
I gotta admit he looks pretty phat
in your Kangol.

296
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,096
[Growls]

297
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,735
Hey! They're about
to pick the lottery numbers.

298
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,711
And remember that when we win,
we win as a family.

299
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,112
I set aside 20 tickets
for you and I to split.

300
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,207
Perfect.

301
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:29,311
Nurse Espinoza, Mr. Foster's cough
is getting worse and Dr. Dorian's gone.

302
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,754
Dr. Reid's covering,
but she's indisposed.

303
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,158
Kid, I'm about to become a millionaire.
Call Dr. Turk, he's the surgeon on-call.

304
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,222
You're missing out.

305
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,858
There's plenty you could do
with a hundred million dollars.

306
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,428
Oh, come on. You gotta make that shot.

307
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,266
[Pounding]

308
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,002
Let me out of here! I will kill you!

309
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,601
I'm watching the game.

310
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,813
Sweetie, you want to get naughty?

311
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,409
Ooh.

312
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,820
Ohh. Ahh.

313
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,723
Ahh.

314
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,933
Come on. Do it. Do it.

315
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,266
I can wait another day.
Button up and watch the game.

316
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,237
I gotta call my glass guy.

317
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,672
Mrs. Brown, I want you to know how
sorry I am for kissing your husband.

318
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,651
But we are two women who
have been wronged and lied to,

319
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,245
and the healthiest thing
for us to do right now,

320
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:42,191
walk away from each other with our
dignity intact. Don't you agree?

321
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,530
Do you know what I do with whores?

322
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,566
I punch them in the face.

323
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,399
Bring it, bitch.

324
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,076
Dude, are you really gonna sit here
all day just to thank your garbage man?

325
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,604
Jabbarie has been added to the
hug schedule. Want to wait with me?

326
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,516
I can't. I was supposed
to be on-call five minutes ago.

327
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,950
<i>This whole experience got me thinking</i>
<i>about the nature of gratitude.</i>

328
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,082
<i>I guess in the end...</i>

329
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,524
Whether you're a doctor
or a garbage man...

330
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,596
Dorian, what are you doing?

331
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,722
Sorry, sir.

332
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,358
Sometimes I like
to just sum things up.

333
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,369
Well, allow me to do that for you.

334
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,168
In the end, when Mr. Foster
started coughing up blood...

335
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,302
[horn honking]

336
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,311
<i>... the on-call surgeon</i>
<i>was stuck in traffic...</i>

337
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,607
<i>... the nursing staff</i>
<i>was busy losing the lottery...</i>

338
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,983
<i>... his original doctor</i>
<i>was thanking a garbage man...</i>

339
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,494
<i>... and the covering physician</i>
<i>was incapacitated.</i>

340
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,832
<i>And what was Mr. Foster doing?</i>

341
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,137
<i>He was dying</i>
<i>in the hands of the interns.</i>

342
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,765
How did I do, Dr. Dorian?

343
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,269
Sorry I'm late. I got the keys
to my Miata stuck in the cadaver.

344
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,713
Cut to the chase there, pee pants.

345
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,218
Mr. Foster's death was the result
of a pulmonary embolism,

346
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,414
probably caused by the 21 -hour
flight he was on from India.

347
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,186
Dr. Flannery, the radiologist,
should have caught it on the scan.

348
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,196
Working from an inaccurate report,

349
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:30,429
there was nothing any of you could have
done to prevent Mr. Foster from passing.

350
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:36,463
Which, I guess, leads us to you,
Dr. Flannery.

351
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,371
<i>After a day like today, there's really</i>
<i>only one thing you can do...</i>

352
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,942
To bad radiologists.

353
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,784
Wait, wait. Let me get in on this.

354
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,916
Let's also have a toast to Mr. Foster's
widow and his fatherless kids.

355
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,051
Dr. Cox, it wasn't our fault.

356
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,393
No, because you were lucky.

357
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,230
You know as well as I do, it could
have been any one of your faults.

358
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:10,168
Congrats again.
Have a... have a swell party.

359
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,909

360
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,539

361
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,014

362
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,415
