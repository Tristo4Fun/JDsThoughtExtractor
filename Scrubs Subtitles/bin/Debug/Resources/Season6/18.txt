1
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:06,188
<i>This saliva heavy display was because</i>

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:08,376
<i>Keith was going out of town for a few days.</i>

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,291
C'mon, Elliot, let me just borrow it
for the weekend. I promise I'll bring it back.

4
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:14,197
No, I need it. Now go.

5
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,963
Whenever he goes away
he always wants to take my tushie.

6
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:20,094
Why doesn't he just do what I did
when we were dating?

7
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,226
Wait until you fall asleep naked
and take a picture of it.

8
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:23,747
Did you actually do that?

9
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:24,941
No!

10
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,560
<i>It's my screensaver!</i>

11
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,321
Whenever we're apart I always get so bummed.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,865
Well, then let's get you cheered up, huh?

13
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:35,175
Look what I just bought
in the back of boy's life.

14
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,541
Spiderman goggles.

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,377
Still gloomy? Let's put on the wipers.

16
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:41,832
Rat roll.

17
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:44,066
- Mmh-mmh.
- Nothing?

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,451
Dr. Beardface.

19
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,432
Let's see if he wants to play maccaroni.

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,195
- How d'you play?
- Comme ça.

21
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,199
One-nothing, your turn.

22
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,632
<i>Playing maccaroni was much more fun
than dealing with a hypocondriac.</i>

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,956
- I have chest tinglies.
- Lloyd...

24
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:04,951
You're 40 years old and
you're a delivery man,

25
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:08,266
so you should be suffering from
a pretty severe case of the

26
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:09,559
"where-did-I-go-wrong-sease".

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,670
But, other than that, you're fine.
I've run every test.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,529
There's nothing wrong with you.

29
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,136
But the pain starts here,

30
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,815
and then it goes along,
and then skips this area,

31
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:24,004
and then starts hurting again here,
and then of course there's the tinglies.

32
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,878
I'm gonna head out now, Lloyd.

33
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,016
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

34
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,908
I call next on maccaroni.

35
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,415
- He plays?
- Dr. Kelso?

36
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:42,169
Would you mind using your gum
to show Elliot your maccaroni skills?

37
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:48,734
Man! He's good.

38
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,522
You know, you really cheered me up today.

39
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,015
- Hell, we haven't hung out a whole year,
I really miss it.  - Yeah, I know.

40
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,071
Uhm, your boyfriend's out of town,
let's hang out tonight.

41
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,362
Oh, I'd love to but I've got dinner
with the partners I got to work late.

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,565
That's too bad.

43
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,831
<i>Since I was checking out that
kid's awesome plastic cow,</i>

44
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>I saw Elliot's friend first.</i>

45
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:08,992
Elliot?

46
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,464
Melody? Oh, my God!

47
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:22,535
{\an8}<I>Aaaaaaaaah!

48
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,968
<i>And just like that, they regressed
to the two 19-year-old</i>

49
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,951
<i>sorority sisters they've once been.</i>

50
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:21,049
Aah, dude, we should get out of here
before they look our way.

51
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:21,421
Why?

52
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:52,578
{\an8}<I>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

53
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,951
There's only one way to stop them!

54
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,795
Show them a picture of Izzy!

55
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,323
Go! Go!

56
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,744
Must... show... picture!

57
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:53,456
Girls?

58
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:55,258
Ooooh!

59
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:56,950
- Oh, that's so good to see you.
- Yes, it's been a while.

60
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,758
Good work!

61
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,767
- Hey!
- Hey, no, I've lost mine.

68
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,745
Thank you, Jerry.

69
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,750
Hey, what's the deal with Elliot's friend?

70
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,327
Break her down for me C-bear?

71
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:23,172
Okay, check it out. She and Elliot
went to college together, right?

72
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:26,308
Welcome to Turk's Booty Breakdown!

73
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,844
Melody O'Hara, Brown University,
5'4'', 103 Lbs.

74
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:36,150
JD, I've got to tell ya
I'm a huge fan of this chick.

75
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:40,122
She seems smart, fun, and she's got
a little bit of a wild street.

76
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,012
Smack it and I'll do a fake sexy "ooh" for you.

77
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:45,913
Boys!

78
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,406
- Ooh!
- Count it!

79
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:51,243
Melody works as a hotel
reviewer for Zagat,

80
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:55,778
has green eyes, perfect feet ( if you're
into that), and here's the best part!

81
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:56,610
Tell'em.

82
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,296
I'm single.

83
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,186
Booya! Busdriver dance us on!

84
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,113
Driving, driving. Passenger on!

85
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:06,488
Ooh!

86
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,437
Driving, driving. Passenger on!

87
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,930
Why don't people dance
the busdriver anymore?

88
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,479
Because it's not a real dance.

89
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,071
Well, it's hunky, it's-it's
a very important dance.

90
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,413
Driving, driving! Inside the bus!

91
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:20,579
Anyway, I know it's hard to believe,

92
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,405
but when I first got to college,
I was a little bit of a--

93
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:24,460
- Dork?
- Geek?

94
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,173
Good Times Sally who gave it away for free?

95
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,840
I was the tramp, you bitch!

96
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:30,892
Liking her.

97
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,605
Waah, you're so much fun!

98
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,035
You know, when we were at campus,

99
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,929
she just jumped on some random dude's back

100
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,435
and then make him take her
wherever she wanted to go.

101
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,251
Remember that time I made
you do that wit Grillface?

102
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:42,076
Yes!

103
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,119
Come on, dude! Just pick a guy!

104
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,124
- Go on!
- Ok...

105
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,448
- Let's go! Aaaah!
- Uh!

106
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,583
Aaaaah! Aaah!

107
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,060
Ooh!

108
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,368
I mean, before that happened,

109
00:05:00,811 --> 00:05:02,978
Grillface's name was just...Steve.

110
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:03,966
Yeah.

111
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:04,943
Uhm.

112
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,504
Why does this bedsheet have two holes in it?

113
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,567
That's on me.

114
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,660
Sometimes at night I haunt pediatrics.

115
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:16,247
Yo! Mickhead! Incoming!

116
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,471
That is a double-side bypass patient

117
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:22,348
with a ruptured spleen on the side.

118
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,327
Hot damn!

119
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,684
How come you do never give
me any good surgeries?

120
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,567
I could do a bypass like fft-fft-fft... done.

121
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,205
Now, Gumbel, that's hardly to point,

122
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:37,035
The older surgical attendants
here are warriors,

123
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,876
hell, if I screw with Mickhead,

124
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,806
he'll send me every
bowel obstruction he gets.

125
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,374
You, on the other hand,

126
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:46,708
you're just not formidable enough
to have ever earned my respect.

127
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,853
I don't even know why I'm speaking with you,

128
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:51,891
in fact I'm going to stop talking right
in the middle of whatever I'm--

129
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,440
Come on, Dr. Cox, help me up.

130
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,149
You want a patient?

131
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,961
Enjoy.

132
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:03,647
Hey, weren't we in an airband together?

133
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,196
Maybe.

134
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:11,873
I think so.

135
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,730
Let's hit the town, later.
I wanna roll with Nancy again.

136
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,417
Who?

137
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,122
That's the name I gave
to her crazy wild side.

138
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:24,718
Uh, I thought that was Gengie.

139
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,962
No, Gengie is your
super-sensitive neurotic side.

140
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,703
You know, something I'm
a neurotic too, because

141
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,180
Someone make me so bummed and I thought that I

142
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,312
- have done so much work with thousand--
- Eeeasy, Gengie.

143
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,066
Breathe... breathe.

144
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:35,951
Later.

145
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,462
I thought you were too
busy to go out, tonight.

146
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,631
Pfft, please, it's Melody.
I dropped everything.

147
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,303
<i> She didn't do that for you!</i>

148
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,609
God, it's so weird. She hasn't
changed at all since college.

149
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,064
I love her for that.

150
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,998
Hey, you can tag along, if you want.

151
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,322
<I>Tag along?

152
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,323
<i>Let her know you're upset, but be subtle.</i>

153
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,242
I'd love to.

154
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:56,740
Okay.

155
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:58,228
There's nothing wrong with you, Lloyd.

156
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,135
Your enzimes are negative,
you have a normal echo.

157
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,509
Does heart trouble even run in your family?

158
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,263
Well, my uncle was shot in the heart.

159
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:07,408
Oh, okay, that helps.

160
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:08,850
- Really?
- No.

161
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,897
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

162
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,564
Hey, it's ok.

163
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,038
But now the Ghost Who Hates
Spills is gonna come.

164
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:20,742
Who?

165
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,273
You're right, Devin.

166
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,272
He might come this very night.

167
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:27,522
And as you know,
that ghost's entire family was killed

168
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,110
by a careless spill.

169
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:30,837
Just like yours.

170
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,695
Just like yours. Hmm.

171
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,654
Ok, this ends now.

172
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,634
Do you know how messy kids can be,

173
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,842
and how clean this place has been ever since...

174
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,118
<i>The Ghost.</i>

175
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,237
Besides, I'm only picking on the tonsil cases.

176
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,385
The spoiled ones who get
ice cream with every meal.

177
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,534
Do you know what I had to eat,
when I had my tonsils out?

178
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:52,840
What?

179
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,671
Hot coffee and granola bars.

180
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:56,034
Hot and scratchy.

181
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,319
Hot and scratchy!

182
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,620
Are you insane?

183
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,188
I'm a little bit tired.

184
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,103
I was up all night learning to rollerblade.

185
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,502
I want the Ghost to be a little more glidey.

186
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,273
Thanks, bro.

187
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,648
Hmmm.

188
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,131
Nice drink. Does it come in ethero?

189
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:20,633
It does, but I didn't like it.

190
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,047
Elliot's running 20 minutes late.

191
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,127
Do you wanna... play darts,
or maybe sing showtunes?

192
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,666
<i>Don't say showtunes! It's a trap!</i>

193
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,822
I mean... I guess we can make out.

194
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,258
<i>Wait, what now?</i>

195
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,886
Yeah, I know, it's a little bit trampy,
but... what the hell! So am I!

196
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,530
The one thing I have twit now
that I'm an adult, is...

197
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,257
I mean... I'll mack anyone...

198
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,685
but that's where I draw the line.

199
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,460
That mack?

200
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,067
Yeah, and if you get too into it, I'll stop.

201
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,487
- Do you wanna think about it?
- What?

202
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,933
<i>Well, this is fun.</i>

203
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,473
- Hands on your side.
- Sorry.

204
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,665
Hey! What the hell...

205
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,867
He was turned back to you
from surgery with endocarditis.

206
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:01,834
Ah-ah!

207
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:04,904
Dr. Turk said I was a present for you.

208
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:06,255
Huh?

209
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:13,542
Is he doing the busdriver?

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,570
Oh, yeah, dude.

211
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,681
Don't get comfortable.

212
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,884
Aortic dissection?

213
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,251
Pulmonary embolism?

214
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:36,631
No.

215
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,072
Splenic infarct?

216
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,307
Hell, no!

217
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:48,218
That's okay, I'll walk myself back.

218
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:54,997
Heads up!

219
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,728
Exciting news there, milkdud.

220
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,133
I've convinced young Lloyd in there, that

221
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,711
the arm pain that he thought
was a heart attack,

222
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,218
was actually just what, Lloyd?

223
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:07,823
Arm pain, Perry.

224
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:11,689
Hey, 100% surgical issue.

225
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,783
It's O.V.E.R.

226
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,590
I win. And, for your dignity sake

227
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,515
please, stop trying
to play with the big boys.

228
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:23,936
<i>As I kissed Melanie </i>

229
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,354
<i>knowing we were headed somewhere amazing...</i>

230
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,421
You moaned! We are done!

231
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,203
No, no, no! We're just macking. Right back in.

232
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:31,659
Where are your hands?

233
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,402
In your pants.

234
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,768
Let's just put these, there.

235
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,956
- All right.
- You know, it's so amazing. It's like...

236
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,998
I haven't seen Elliot in so long
and now she is this big time doctor.

237
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,898
I just wonder what she thinks like seeing me.

238
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:50,730
<i>I was still mad at Elliot, so I said this:</i>

239
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,013
She actually said she thought
it was a little weird

240
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,962
that you haven't changed since college.

241
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,356
<i>I left out that Elliot loved that.</i>

242
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:01,380
Hey, guys!

243
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,733
<i>We've all made a few rash moves in our time.</i>

244
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:07,925
Now, it's really over.

245
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,216
Oh, yeah? What did you do? Killed him?

246
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,042
- What's up, dude?
- Wassup?

247
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,014
You said it was an arm pain,
so I operated on his arm.

248
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,752
But there was nothing wrong with him.
Are you crazy?

249
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:23,352
Look, the man wanted
something done? I did it.

250
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,553
End of story.

251
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:27,671
Good day.

252
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,422
<i>Ultimately you have to hope your rash move</i>

253
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,952
<i>doesn't cause too many problems.</i>

254
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,783
Ok, Gengie is wondering
whether or not her hair is working

255
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,993
but Nancy, was ready to roll:
"What's the plan"?

256
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,073
I'm sorry. Uh... I have to get going.

257
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:43,087
Is she pissed at me?

258
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,956
Why would she be pissed?

259
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,047
Hey, Elliot, are you and Melody ok?

260
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:54,903
No!

261
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,148
She wouldn't tell me why she's so pissed.

262
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,289
'cause it's so weird. I mean,
I always regress when I meet

263
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,472
people from my past, you know?

264
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:02,444
I mean, she's been just as passive-aggressive

265
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,645
as she was when we were nineteen.

266
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:06,933
I'm actually wishing she had a boyfriend

267
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,181
I'd go mack with to get back at her.

268
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:09,937
<i>Ok, this has gone far enough.</i>

269
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,181
<i>You can't just mess up
Elliot and Melody friendship.</i>

270
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:17,505
<i>You have to come clean.
Tell her you started their fight!</i>

271
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:21,430
I guess it doesn't matter anyway,
I mean, she's already left town.

272
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,176
<i>Or, you can say nothing.</i>

273
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,580
Well, since Keith is still gone

274
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:27,727
maybe we could use that raincheck tonight and...

275
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,004
hang out.

276
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,375
Yeah!

277
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,309
Thanks. I'd like that.

278
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,262
Cool.

279
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:37,531
Boo.

280
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:40,697
That can't be good.

281
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:46,104
Look, in this world,
when you try to set the score

282
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:48,565
there are things you can do
and things you cannot do.

283
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,410
Under no circumstances can you ever

284
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,728
perform unecessary surgery

285
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,494
just to unload an annoying patient.

286
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,925
Uhm, did I get drunk last night

287
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,714
and sent you an e-mail asking for
your opinion about what I did?

288
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,799
I don't know. I didn't check.

289
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:04,844
Dr. Turkleberry,

290
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:08,423
can you please explain to me
why you performed surgery on that patient?

291
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,193
Better yet, you can tell it
to the ethics committee

292
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:14,253
later on today. Maybe they'll just
slap you with a suspension

293
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,161
instead of taking away your licence.

294
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,184
<i>That night Elliot and I went out.</i>

295
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:22,423
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

296
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,048
Ok, how many beers?

297
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,194
Ehm, let's say about eight
before she would do you.

298
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,245
<i>Yep. It was just like old times.</i>

299
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:32,733
Hello, Elliot.

300
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,875
Hit that thing,
It stops like that all the time.

301
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:41,518
Hey, I'm the Fonz!

302
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:46,588
Did you see that?

303
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,879
- No.
- Good. Elliot, we're adults now.

304
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:51,396
I don't want to behave the way
we used to, and I'm not leaving mad.

305
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,453
I don't even know why you're mad.

306
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,791
You told JD that it was weird

307
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,453
I haven't changed since college.

308
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:00,101
Yeah, I said that I loved that about you.

309
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,288
Did I not mention that?

310
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,453
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,579
I'm reading Mr Goodner's chart,

312
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:13,903
but if you like me to be more specific,

313
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:17,076
I'm also standing, breathing,
thinking and now...

314
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,461
talking, which is actually
preventing me from

315
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,413
what I was originally trying to do.

316
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,432
Turk's career is in danger and you're
gonna toss that attitude in my way?

317
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,253
I've never asked him to operate on that guy.

318
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,558
No! You tortured him into playing a game

319
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,103
he shouldn't have been playin'.

320
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,385
Never mind that you and I
are supposed to be friends,

321
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,213
and that I've just had a baby that I was hoping

322
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:36,867
my husband will help to support.

323
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,285
What horrible thing did Turk do
to piss you off in the first place?

324
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,735
He asked me to occasionally...

325
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,416
toss him a good surgery.

326
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,740
Oh! Well, if he didn't apologize for that,

327
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,027
let me do it for him.

328
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:53,036
He's so sorry.

329
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,736
Don't worry about it.

330
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,220
You know what, I should probably go. It's late.

331
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,341
I forgot to pay my check.

332
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,257
There's a credit card for you.

333
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,365
It's quiet in here.
I think the music went off again.

334
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,115
Someone'll top that juke box for me?

335
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,312
No? Okay.

336
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:32,011
Wow! You guys can staring off a long time
without letting your eyes blink.

337
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,186
That's amazing! That's...

338
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,007
I've tried to do that and I...

339
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:37,955
cannot really...

340
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:39,542
do it..

341
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,115
- ...when I've tried.
- Sorry, the...

342
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,321
- ... she's busted.
- Unfortunate.

343
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:47,419
Okay. Thank you, Frank. I will pay cash.

344
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,565
Ben Franklin here should take care of things.

345
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,565
A one hundred dollar bill.

346
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,480
I don't got change for that.

347
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,734
He doesn't got change.
That's how he says that.

348
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,499
Okay. Mmh.. Surely one
of my lady friends could...

349
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,259
No. All right.

350
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:06,067
You know what?
I'm going to pay one hundred dollars

351
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,409
for that Appletini.

352
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:09,878
I like you. You're a good barman.

353
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,747
You never teased me,
when I ordered the 'tinis.

354
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:12,989
Drink it myself.

355
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,829
Good... Night.

356
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,820
I can't spend a hundred dollars
on an Appletini!

357
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:25,083
It's absurd! That's like
ten Tinis, with the tip!

358
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:27,402
No, that must be something
else I can buy. How much is that

359
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,167
weird melted fox tale?

360
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,140
Actually that's a beard.

361
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,599
Well, keep that then.
It's probably a family heirloom.

362
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,609
You know what, Frank? I'm gonna do it.

363
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,853
One hundred dollars...

364
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,938
for one Appletini.

365
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,600
That was frankly light on the Tini.

366
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:44,689
All right.

367
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:46,342
Good night.

368
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:50,632
-  I found a fiver in my pocket..
- No!

369
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:52,172
Keep that too.

370
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,853
Well, of course I'd like
to get to know you better.

371
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:01,252
What is it, Perry?

372
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,083
Well Bob,

373
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:07,206
what I'm about to say is so painful,

374
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:11,460
that I plan on erasing it from my
memory, tonight, by drinking a feet of Jack

375
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,878
- ..in challenging.
- One moment. Perry, I wanna see this.

376
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:18,118
Go ahead!

377
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,690
I know that, Gandhi must stop, I do.

378
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:25,968
But I need you to let him off the hook.

379
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,183
And, why is that?

380
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:31,723
Because I pushed him into it.

381
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:32,972
Okay? Or...

382
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,057
because he's a good person, and better yet
because he's a good surgeon.

383
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:38,793
Then, I'll think about it.

384
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:40,061
Bye bye.

385
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:44,558
<i>Sometimes standing up for someone</i>

386
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,426
<i>still isn't enough to make the guilt go away.</i>

387
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:56,492
That is cool!

388
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:58,578
No scar!

389
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,005
Oh!

390
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,221
You never operated on him!?

391
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:05,724
But he...

392
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,724
he said he watched his own surgery.

393
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,199
Oh, he thinks he did.

394
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:10,504
I put up a divider,

395
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:11,997
sprayed on some local anaestetic,

396
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:14,401
and then put Mrs. Nouabi's
heart surgery on the TV.

397
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:18,760
What's that thing?

398
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,924
Oh, that's your shoulder sack.

399
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,051
Dude!

400
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,258
You... tricked me?

401
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,550
I couldn't have done it
without my supporting players.

402
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:31,296
Ladies and Gentlemen,
my muse, my shining light...

403
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,339
Miss Carla Turk.

404
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:35,982
Stop being mean to my husband!

405
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,522
And of course,

406
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,142
playing the cantankerous chief of medicine,

407
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,124
you know him,

408
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,861
you love to hate him,

409
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:47,194
Dr. Boooooob Kelso!

410
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:58,875
Again.

411
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,324
Ah, that was fun.

412
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,362
Don't mess with me ever again.

413
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:17,674
- I'm so proud of you, baby!
- You know what I do when I do...

414
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,295
JD,

415
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,210
what the hell were you doing in there?

416
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,188
I don't know.

417
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,906
I guess I was just pissed off that you'd
cancel your plans for Melody but not for me.

418
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,168
She was only in town for a couple of days.

419
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,370
I get it, I'm an idiot.
It's just that, Elliott,

420
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,403
when was the last time we
made any time for each other?

421
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,520
We used to be so close, and...

422
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:43,159
it just doesn't feel like we are anymore.

423
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:45,309
Look,

424
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,412
you know what it's like
when you're in a relationship.

425
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:49,243
Not to mention work.

426
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,351
Plus Turk's your best friend,
and Carla's my best friend.

427
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,483
I wanna be Turk's best friend
and your best friend.

428
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:58,925
I just don't wanna lose you.

429
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,013
Then we'll both try harder.

430
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,263
Take me over to them.

431
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,385
Come on now, mush!

432
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,135
<i>I guess all relationships have to evolve...</i>

433
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:13,478
Gandhi, incoming.

434
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:16,717
Mr. Randolph's Nissen fundoplication.

435
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:17,957
It's all yours.

436
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,582
<i>There's nothing you can do
to stop it, even if you wanted to.</i>

437
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:29,253
Keith?

438
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:30,749
Elliot,

439
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:33,782
I didn't go home to see my family.

440
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:39,379
I went to see your father
to ask his permission to do this.

441
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:40,477
Oh!

442
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:43,764
Elliot,

443
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:45,744
will you marry me?

444
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:50,636
No way!

445
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:52,617
<i>Yep...</i>

446
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,420
<i>such is life.</i>
