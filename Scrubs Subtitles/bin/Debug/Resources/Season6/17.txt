1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,720
<i>Lately, people around here
were happier then usual.</i>

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:07,016
<i>Elliot, because she had finally said
those three magic words,</i>

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:08,360
I love you.

4
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:13,269
<i>Todd, because he had finally found
his true calling as a doctor,</i>

5
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:16,169
- So what's up with the plastic surgery?
- Dude, that's amazing.

6
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:20,235
Just when you think you can't see another
great pair of boobs you see an awesome dong.

7
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:23,355
<i>And Dr. Kelso was giddy because
it was the first monday of the month.</i>

8
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:28,447
<i>And today nothing could dumpen
his spirits, not even a grieving family.</i>

9
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:30,923
I am so sorry for your loss.

10
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:35,803
He was a fighter right to the end...
We did... everything we could.

11
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:41,546
<i>See, today was the day
the hypodermic needles arrived.</i>

12
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,087
- Happy needleday, Lloyd.
- And to you, Sir.

13
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,845
And thanks for sending down
an extra set of hands.

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,515
I'm a lawyer!

15
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:54,221
I still don't understand why
you get so excited over needles.

16
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,457
Thanks to a delightful decimal
error made 20 years ago,

17
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,081
by the good folks at Zephir Pharmaceuticals,

18
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:06,138
each month Sacred Heart gets 50.000
dollars worth of hypodermic needles

19
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:09,033
with a low, low price of 50 dollars.

20
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:10,587
That's it.

21
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:13,529
I can't feel my arms.

22
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:19,597
Now, Lloyd, given your past history
as a dirtbag junkee, I have to ask:

23
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:24,619
- Did you take any of uncle Bob's needles?
- No Sir.

24
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,856
- I don't use needles anymore.
- Oh, so you finally got clean?

25
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:32,483
- Nope! Sign here.
- This is a straw, Lloyd.

26
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:36,501
Dr. Reid! I have a package for you.

27
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,920
It's addressed to your home,
but since you are here...

28
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,769
Lloyd, I wanted that delivered
to my house because it's private

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,169
and it would be embarrassing for me
to open it here at the hospital.

30
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,652
- We--we can't.
- We have to.

31
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,877
Wait. You're talking about
opening someone else's mail.

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,164
Maybe we should stop for a moment and
consider the ethical implications here.

33
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:58,384
All done.

34
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,585
Awwww!

35
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:08,414
Keith? I'm home!

36
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:12,571
Hey, Dr. Reid.
We accidentally opened your package,

37
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,586
and felt so guilty we
came by to install your...

38
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:18,344
"Slide & Glide stripper pole".

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,971
How did you get in there?

40
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:23,892
- Hooot cookies, anyone!
- Keith?

41
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:29,165
Do you know how hard it is
to install those things? Just be grateful.

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,430
- You guys are gonna love this!
- Oh, yeah!

43
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:41,301
- Why did he take off his shirt?
- I don't know, Keith.

50
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,661
I have a small low fat latte for Dr. Dorian.

51
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:02,321
What the hell, long face,
we were here first.

52
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:04,131
Yeah, but Dr. D. is a king.

53
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:06,748
I didn't ask to be special,
just kinda happened.

54
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,503
<i>Still after six years
of being a star around here,</i>

55
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,246
<i>I couldn't help of wonder what would be like</i>

56
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:14,631
<i>if the spotlight were on some of my
supporting players, for a change.</i>

57
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:18,521
- Jumbo coffee for Todd?
- Everything's Jumbo on the Todd.

58
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,543
<i>It doesn't matter that is a dude,
people should know: you're well endowed.</i>

59
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,626
- Cappuccino for Jordan?
- Give me that!

60
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,903
<i>Now, let's see who I can sit with
that will drive me the least insane.</i>

61
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:34,180
<i>Ah, definitely not.</i>

62
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,269
<i>Oh, what a sweet moment. I should ruin it.</i>

63
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:39,768
Stop that!

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,932
We're on me now.

65
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,916
Extra hot tea for Ted.

66
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:48,552
<i>Ooh! He didn't give you a cardboard sleeve!</i>

67
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:52,031
<i>Still don't rock the ball.
You don't want people staring.</i>

68
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:56,162
<i>Besides, how hot can it be...
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!</i>

69
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,430
HUGE MISTAKE! HUGE MISTAKE!

70
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,840
<I>Just keep moving. No one saw that.

71
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,815
<i>Naaah! Kelso.</i>

72
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:11,752
<i>What's going on?</i>

73
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:15,769
<i>Hey, maybe it's the surprise party
you've been waiting for your whole life.</i>

74
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:18,895
<i>Just, play it cool, Teddy boy.</i>

75
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,762
The party man is here!

76
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:24,356
It's not a surprise party, Ted. It'll never be.

77
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:31,192
Nurse Espinosa and her chiquita nursitas
are here because they want more dinero.

78
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,781
<i>Dr. Kelso and his racism on.</i>

79
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,869
We are not asking for much.
Just the basic cost of living raise.

80
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,580
No chance, pink pants.

81
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,622
Sir, the last thing we need

82
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:46,019
- is a strike!
- They'll never do it, Ted.

83
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:51,168
A strike will hurt the patients. See?
That's their biggest weakness.

84
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,318
They care about the patients.

85
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:57,660
- This isn't over, Dr. Kelso.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! Scram.

86
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:02,067
Sir, they aren't asking for much

87
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,521
and a little thing can make a big difference.

88
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:07,138
I know i'll be a lot happier
with some extra cash,

89
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:08,751
or friends,

90
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:10,293
or hair.

91
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:13,348
How would your life be
any different, if you had hair?

92
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,100
Don't worry baby, you'll get your turn.

93
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,476
Which conditioner are you going to buy?

94
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,591
Too many choices!

95
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,917
Mum?

96
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:52,816
Nooooo! Why do I have hair?

97
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,532
Why? Why I have hair?

98
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,658
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?

99
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,457
I wonder if they'd still do me
after I buried mum!

100
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:09,422
- Rounds sucked today.
- I know,

101
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:13,595
Dr. Wen didn't set me up once.
He never said bone, organ, suction.

102
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,706
I mean, I did what I could with
"carpal tunnel", but i don't think people got

103
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:19,104
that I was using that as a metaphore for vagina.

104
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,002
No, Todd,

105
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:24,232
I'm talking about when that intern asked
me about cardiovascular instabilities?

106
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,042
Pff... dude.

107
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:29,791
Turk 's bummed. He definitely
needs an high-five, but which one?

108
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:33,582
Chin-up five? Tough-to-be-black five?
Need-a-hug five - need-a-tug five?

109
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,944
Wait! What's he talking about?

110
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,956
Ok, just take the last one
he says and add a five, dude.

111
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:40,966
...Oh, I dunno, it just
all seems a little unfair.

112
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,239
Unfair five.

113
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:44,318
Thanks, mate. You always

114
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,625
- have the right thing to say.
- I work hard on this.

115
00:06:47,592 --> 00:06:49,214
Excuse me, Dr. Quinlan?

116
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:51,166
- Who?
- That's you, Todd.

117
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,490
I just wanna thank you for helping
with my daughter's condition.

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,304
It's hard enough being 16 and
she shouldn't have to be teased

119
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,728
by her classmates just
because she looks so different.

120
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,779
I am glad to help, ma'am.

121
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,306
You are making a difference
to her daughter's life.

122
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,432
What are you fixing, some type
of major facial deformity?

123
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,936
No, I'm giving her giant cans.

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,138
Okay!

125
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:19,019
Uhm, have you ever heard
the phrase "Excuse me"?

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,064
Here, take the fake sugars, 'cause
I hope you get cancer, I really do.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,399
* Crowd disapproves *

128
00:07:27,845 --> 00:07:30,080
Well, my parents were mean to me.

129
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,061
* Crowd understands *

130
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,820
Keith and I are always so busy that

131
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,720
he suggested that we meet here
for ten minutes before I should start

132
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,591
for coffee, and for some
together-time. Is it not sweet?

133
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,962
That may have been the
most bored I have ever been

134
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,028
whilst someone was talking to me.

135
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,565
- She's ruining our coffee time.
- Just pretend she's not here.

136
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:53,026
So, anyway, explain

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,822
<i>Uh, I hate everybody.</i>

138
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,849
<i>Oh, look at those two. It must
be the Beard of the Month Club.</i>

139
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:02,248
<i> "My beard is nice and white."
"But my beard is more bushy."</i>

140
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,332
"Yeah, let's be friends."
Morons.

141
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,963
- I love you.
- I love you too.

142
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,112
Wow, what the hell was that?

143
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,951
Funny I told Keith I loved him?

144
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,473
Now that you said what he wanted
to hear, he doesn't have to work for it.

145
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,076
Let's say one guy is really
trying to sleep with you.

146
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,764
When you finally give it up,
do no more flowers.

147
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,846
Next thing you know, it's 20 years
later, and you're standing over

148
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:30,440
while he sleeps, your third Martini in
one hand and a steak knife in the other.

149
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:33,015
And sure, he's taking his sleeping pills,

150
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:36,481
so you can slice his arm open
a little bit without waking him up.

151
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,366
But it's not satisfying, and you know why?

152
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,233
Because you've lost the power.

153
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,925
Hey Per-Per! Did you figure out
what happened to your arm?

154
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:46,497
Nope.

155
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:51,233
Yes... phew... yes...

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,859
Carla, can you pull a file for me?

157
00:08:56,707 --> 00:09:01,404
Sorry, I need another 5 hours to put
this box of needles away.

158
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,743
- I don't get it.
- It's a slowdown, Ted.

159
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,809
The nurses think they're being clever.

160
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:10,684
Still treating patients, but with
everything else moving more slowly.

161
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,813
And why are you standing here
doing nothing?

162
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:18,380
I know this is a slowdown, but I can't really
work any slower than I normally do, so...

163
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,395
I pretty much have to come to
completely stop.

164
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,108
Now, if you're asking why I'm
standing here, specifically,

165
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,291
it's because I replaced that light bulb
with a tanning bulb.

166
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,968
I'm tired of being the
only white guy in my mosque.

167
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,039
You know what, if the nurses keep
going on like this,

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,616
I'm going to get them their raise, but I'm
going to pay for it by firing 3 of them.

169
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:39,128
The ugly ones, how does that sound?

170
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:40,903
<i>Whatever you think is right, sir.</i>

171
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,246
You're an ass.

172
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,100
<i>Ted, you idiot, you just said
theout-loud thing in your head </i>

173
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:46,809
<i>and the in-your-head thing out loud!</i>

174
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,597
<i>Don't make eye-contact,
just keep moving!</i>

175
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,789
I'm sorry but that mother should not
be giving her little girl

176
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,537
a breast implant for her sweet sixteen present.

177
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,063
So she's sixteen. What's the big deal, T.Do?

178
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:04,152
Oh, I have a daughter...
imagine being a parent.

179
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,767
Dad, can I talk to you?

180
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,195
What's up?

181
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,749
I don't want to wear a
banana hammock anymore.

182
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,129
Rod... why?

183
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,753
Because I stuff.

184
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,119
Wanna know a secret?

185
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,128
I stuff too.

186
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,099
Yeah, you go.

187
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,541
I don't stuff.

188
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,372
Maybe you should.

189
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:41,729
You know what, I will just have
a little conversation with your...

190
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:43,335
department head.

191
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,946
All I'm saying is, it's not right,
the girl's only sixteen.

192
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:51,739
Yeah, know, I felt the same way until
her mother's cheque cleared.

193
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:55,664
Look, you're not even in my department,
so maybe I'm missing something here,

194
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:58,735
do... do you see any of your bees'wax
here, beacuse I sure as hell don't,

195
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:01,072
Dr. Todd, do you see Dr. Turk's bees'wax?

196
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:02,922
<i>What the hell was he talking about?</i>

197
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:03,927
Todd, come.

198
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,091
Look, I know your buddy thinks
he's the bee sneeze...

199
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,828
<i>What is it with this student beez?</i>

200
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,096
But if he keeps poking his nose
in my business, I will torch him

201
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:17,091
with every other department head in
this place. See how that ups his career.

202
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,823
Internal ohoh-five!

203
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,053
Oh-oh!

204
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,485
What took you so long? I need a drink!

205
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:31,187
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, I was just
with this super-rude patient,

206
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,278
whose heart kept stopping. He's dead now,

207
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,945
but darn it all he should have known
that my ex-wife

208
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,518
was down here jonesing for a Cosmo.

209
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,912
<i>You're so getting cut again, tonight.</i>

210
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,264
I've got to get my jacket.

211
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:47,180
Already, Trish, I'm off
to the movies with my boyfriend,

212
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,809
who doesn't treat me any differently
even though I've already said I loved him.

213
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,094
- My name's not Trish.
- Oh, that's ok. It was for her benefit.

214
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,976
- Hey sweetie. Hey.
- Oh.

215
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:00,671
Uhm, the guys are gonna play poker,
is it ok if we skip the movie?

216
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,146
Sure.

217
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:03,780
Oh, thanks babe.

218
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:06,607
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

219
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,701
<i>Let the dark side draw her in.</i>

220
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,899
<i>Come on, come to mama.</i>

221
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,824
- Jordan, teach me.
- Ok, it's simple.

222
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:15,941
If he thinks it's ok to mess with you,
you just mess with him.

223
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:17,444
Done.

224
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,162
<i>Ah, it's so fun to screw with
someone's relationships.</i>

225
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,585
<i>And such a good practice for
when my daughter grows up.</i>

226
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,172
<i>- Still want someone...</i>

227
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,505
<i>Who is heading down a bad path,
I'd always try to stop them.</i>

228
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:32,365
Carla, I think you should
reconsider the slowdown.

229
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,486
Can't talk, Ted.

230
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,476
Julie and I have to carry this
chart to this patient's room.

231
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,595
<i>Of course there is nothing I can do.</i>

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,299
<i>If there is stubborn as Turk is...</i>

233
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,700
This isn't over man, I call
she's not be having surgery.

234
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:50,106
- Dude, you shouldn't screw with Dr.Green.
- I'm not afraid of Dr.Green!

235
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,930
<i>Great! That just makes me want to...</i>

236
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,150
<i>Laugh and laugh and laugh...</i>

237
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,189
<i>I mean...look at him there by himself,
probate him for frenzies.</i>

238
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,190
Hey Keith!

239
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,490
Where's Blondie? I thought it was
your little coffee day time.

240
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,253
If she was mad about something,
why wouldn't she just tell me?

241
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:11,814
Now, I guess that, uh...once
you've finally said I love you,

242
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,165
all this insecure game
might stop, you know?

243
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,808
Bye, Jordan.

244
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,145
<i>That did not give me the delicious,
statisfied feeling I was going for.</i>

245
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,689
Oh look, it's Keith. Yeah, if he wants
to talk to me he can find me, right?

246
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:34,535
Right!

247
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:38,074
Perry? I think there's
something wrong with me.

248
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:42,329
Now that is the understatement
of this still very young century.

249
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,786
I may have screwed up
BlondeSteak's relationship,

250
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,808
and now I have this
really weird feeling.

251
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,982
It's called guilt, you Volcan.

252
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:54,031
And why in the hell are you giving
up relationship advices, anyway?

253
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:54,830
What are you, Oprah?

254
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:04,949
Hi everyone! We're back, we're talking
with Barbara, a cancer survivor,

255
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,525
who went on to form her own headscarf company.

256
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:11,697
- Tell us about that!
- When my hair fell out for the chemo...

257
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,798
Not only is that a huge downer
but scarves are tacky.

258
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:20,009
Instead, how about a dance with
a little girl who looks just like me?

259
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,267
Yeah!

260
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,889
Right, look at us, we're like twins!

261
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,718
Can you believe it?

262
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,259
I would watch that show!

263
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:35,848
Anyway, go fix this for me!

264
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,540
Barbie can handle this on
her own, she is an adult.

265
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,545
Aaah. See Keith? I've been
practicing and you're missing it.

266
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,475
- Prrrr.
- Where are my 12, 13 bucks?

267
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:53,252
Ah. Just send it to Keith, Lloyd!

268
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:57,292
Oh! Come on! Oh!

269
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,665
JD, Turk shouldn't mess with Dr.Green!

270
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,838
Now, even though you're only
his second best friend,

271
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,385
for some reason he listens to you.

272
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:06,526
If Turk's mind is set on something,
it can't be changed.

273
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,690
I can't even imagine how I'd try!

274
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:12,243
<i>Oh great. There he goes off
into his fantasy world.</i>

275
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:15,814
<i>Now I'm stuck here waiting until he snaps
out of it with some weird comment.</i>

276
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,854
- We'd have to find a whole lot of gnomes!
- That's helpful.

277
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,492
- Excuse me?
- Hold, one sec. Got to make one of these.

278
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:30,295
Ah! Damn it!

279
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:33,816
- What are you aiming at?
- Nothing. What's on your mind?

280
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,818
Carla needs to end this slow down
but she won't listen to me,

281
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,082
people rarely do, would you talk to her?

282
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:46,163
Yes! Nope, can't do it Ted.
If you piss her off,

283
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,803
she's gonna turn on you and I can't have her
digging off the skeletons in my closet,

284
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,369
although technically there won't
be skeletons for 6 days a week,

285
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,368
right now there's just... dead badgers.

286
00:15:56,026 --> 00:16:01,620
<i>Ok, time to set things straight with
the new bride. Bug I straw heard!</i>

287
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:04,518
- My parents were mean to me.
- Oh, you don't need to say that,

288
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,476
I don't know what you were thinking...
although I'm... sure that was lovely.

289
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,785
<i>I need someone Turk will listen to.</i>

290
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:18,369
<i>Someone persuasive, forceful,
sensitive. Only my dong could talk.</i>

291
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,478
<i>Hey! I bet he'd listen to you!</i>

292
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:27,091
<i>I've got to find a way to stop this
slowdown before someone loses their job!</i>

293
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,302
The stress is killing me!

294
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,611
You're sweating because you're
under the tanning bulb, genius!

295
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,074
<i>If only the nurses have
leverage, I could help them.</i>

296
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:44,565
Ted, I found this extra box
of needles in my truck.

297
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:46,283
Needles?

298
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:48,658
There's a leverage.

299
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,630
Man, you keep this place toasty!

300
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,954
So you wanted to talk to me?

301
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,179
I'm about to speak to you from the heart,

302
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,856
and since that's very difficult for me,

303
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:05,044
I need you to sit there silently
while I mentally prepare myself.

304
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:06,640
- Jordan, I have patients--
- Shoo-shoosh!

305
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:07,105
Sorry.

306
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:12,192
Todd, right now mean you the
pop of my head but to have it up!

307
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:14,422
This surgery ain't happening.
Now, one more watch!

308
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,723
I always wanted to say that.

309
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,356
Before you do anything,
just listen to what she has to say.

310
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,347
I want the implants.

311
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,450
Look, I'm constantly mistaken for
a fifth grader, and I'm tired of it.

312
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:28,577
This is my choice.

313
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,588
It's taking me a long time
to convince my mom, but...

314
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:33,490
she's finally supporting me.

315
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,036
I shouldn't have to convince you, too.

316
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,908
What you buzzing around here for?

317
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,348
Dr. Quinlan and I had to discuss something,

318
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:49,003
that has absolutely nothing to do
with anything that's happening up in here.

319
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:52,488
So... uhm... you were right, and... ok.

320
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:57,706
Huh, he's a buzzy little bee.

321
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:01,689
Dude...I gotta ask, what's with you and bees?

322
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:05,582
What are you thinking, Ted?

323
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:08,649
I could jam this through the
soft spot on his temple,

324
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,512
then slit my wrists with it before
anyone got in here to stop me.

325
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,153
The usual, sir.

326
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,277
Well, you'd never do it.
You don't have the guts!

327
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,267
If it's okay with you,
we'll take that raise now.

328
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay,

329
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:27,309
but in this little fantasy of yours,
can I not have prostate problems anymore?

330
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,637
I can't sleep more than forty minutes
without needing to take a weez.

331
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:35,481
Unfortunately for you, somebody left the invoice
for the hospital needles on my desk.

332
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,309
They're really undercharging you!

333
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,770
So...

334
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:44,342
either you shell out the extra twenty
grand a month for our raises, or...

335
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,634
we'll call the needle company
and it'll cost you twice that.

336
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:51,799
Ted, are you responsible for this?

337
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:54,797
Please, sir... I don't have the guts!

338
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,022
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

339
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:01,236
<i>Suck it, bitch! I will murder you!</i>

340
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,716
I don't know why I messed with your head.

341
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,206
Di-di-did you start talking?

342
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,198
'Cause I should brush my teeth.

343
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,925
At first I thought, I was just being mean,

344
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:15,369
'cause you know I enjoy the misery of others.

345
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,385
It's not really a secret.

346
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,055
Whenever I see someone in love,

347
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:23,308
I just lose it and turn into an awful person.

348
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:27,056
Give yourself a break, Jordan.
Your parents were really mean to you.

349
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:30,115
Here's the big secret: they weren't.

350
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:33,652
They were actually very supportive.
I don't know how this happened.

351
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:39,221
Look, Elliot, I'm a woman
in her very very very late 30s,

352
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:42,298
who has problems opening herself up to love.

353
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:46,100
I hate being vulnerable.
I still play mindgames,

354
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:50,556
Hell, to make Perry feel inadequate,
sometimes I fake NOT having orgasms.

355
00:19:51,175 --> 00:19:51,723
Huh.

356
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,676
The point is... if you wanna be happy,

357
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,312
you should never ever listen to me.

358
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,432
You maybe also wanna say you're sorry?

359
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,430
- I do not.
- Hmm.

360
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,388
Come on.

361
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,111
I'm sorry. I was such a jerk.

362
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,145
I love you.

363
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,407
<i>Even though I caused it,</i>

364
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:24,277
<i>it still feels mildly heart-warming
to fix someone's problems.</i>

365
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,177
- Hm! Aw.
- Sir.

366
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:30,360
<i>That's why I'm glad I kept Turk
from messing up his career.</i>

367
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:34,551
<i>And I don't care if the nurses ever find out
that it was me who helped them.</i>

368
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:37,609
* Nurses happily chatting *

369
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,589
<i>I guess we all have our parts to play.</i>

370
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,589
<i>I guess we all have our parts to play.
I guess we all have our parts to play.</i>

371
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,754
Ok, I have a coffe for Snoop Dogg Resident.

372
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,803
<i>I wish just one, someone,
would call me Ronald.</i>

373
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,625
<i>Where I parked my truck?</i>

374
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,595
<i>Bees... bees... bees.</i>

375
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:53,080
* We hear all people's thoughts *
