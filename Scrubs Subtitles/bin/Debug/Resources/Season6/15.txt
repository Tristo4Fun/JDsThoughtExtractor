00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:06,146
<i>Yesterday Laverne was in a car accident,</i>

2
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:07,881
<i>It was all we can think about.</i>

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,252
- How she doing?
- Major head trauma.

4
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:14,542
We've to place a CVP ball
to low the pressure on the brain.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,416
Now we just cross our fingers and wait.

6
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:22,043
Everyone deals with the hurting differently.
Some of us did something life-affirming.

7
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,483
- Whaa!
- Ah!

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,107
Aaah. What is it, like-like 4 times?

9
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:30,176
Let's see.

10
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:38,633
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

11
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,326
Five. I'm so sad!

12
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:42,953
Again.

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>Others resorted to childish mischief.</i>

14
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,921
I love mailbox baseball.
Here comes his house.

15
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,072
I've been wanting to do this for 6 years!

16
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:00,693
Nice try, Turkleton.

17
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,702
But Enid kept taking out the
mailbox with the motorhome,

18
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,691
so I had it reinforced with titanium.

19
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,616
- Aaah.
- Beautiful morning.

20
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,583
<i>And some people just need
to do something impulsive.</i>

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,310
There. Noobie liked my haircut
so now they can all just suck it.

22
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:21,674
Yeah, you win.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,374
God! I can't believe
I'm getting my C-section today.

24
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:28,248
Did... d'you forget to tell... anyone?

25
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:32,160
No...I told the nanny to stay overnight

26
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:37,475
and my mum booked a flight for next week, and
I'm meeting the OB at the hospital in 2 hours.

27
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,253
- Nuh?
- Did I not tell you?

28
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:45,166
- You did not!
- I could have sworn I texted you.

29
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:49,530
Well, it's for the best, 'cause if you knew
you just would get all panicky and annoying.

30
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,160
In this way you only have
to freak out for a couple of hours,

31
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:55,884
most of which I'll be unconscious.
Kind of like our honeymoon.

32
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:59,490
Eeeexcept this time, when you wake up,
you'll have a baby girl in your arms

33
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,820
instead of the Bolivian limbo champion.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,966
Oh, Marco, what a cheeky monkey!

35
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:06,990
How come we don't travel anymore?

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,924
<i>Carla had the difficult job
of talking to Laverne's family.</i>

37
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,930
So there's a chance she
may never wake up?

38
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,844
Well Lester, we just don't know that yet.

39
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:22,968
<i>I wish there was an easier
way to bring bad news to people.</i>

40
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:25,579
So what's wrong
with me doc?

41
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:30,285
Mr. Goodbar, I think you'll be best
if we brought in the bad news robot.

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,765
Hello random patient.
You've cancer.

43
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:39,208
Press 1 for a reassuring
peptalk. Press 2 to give up.

44
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:43,627
You pressed 1 for a reassuring peptalk.

45
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,483
You're strong. You can beat this.

46
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,071
Beat this, beat this, beat this,
beat this...

47
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,056
- Stupid robot!
- Aw.

48
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:00,934
I'm so sorry but your father
has had a massive system's failure.

49
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:04,865
- Oh daddy, no.
- It started in his hard drive and then

50
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,539
worked his way to
all the other circuits.

51
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:10,323
I know this is a very difficult time for you.

52
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:14,579
Ah, ah, ah, argh...

53
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,948
Sure, this ain't a great de-messenger.

54
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,496
Dude, I need to talk to you.

55
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:29,915
Dr. Wen kept referring to her as the patient,

56
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,798
but it's like, that's not the patient,
that's Laverne, you know?

57
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:33,829
I know.

58
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,398
Dude!

65
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,068
You've taught me so much
over the years, Laverne.

66
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:13,141
Like how to place an IV without bruising, or...

67
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:16,484
how to get lab results faster, or the fact that

68
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,437
when white people come in out of the rain
they smell like a dog....we do.

69
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,232
We really do.

70
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,294
Uhm... I, uhm...went to your desk,
and got your favourite makeup,

71
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:37,350
You're such a beautiful woman, Laverne,

72
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,219
you always deserve to look your best.

73
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:49,732
Checking in on her?

74
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,696
Just make sure she knows
how much I care about her.

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,916
As long as you're not saying goodbye,
I mean, people have come back from worse.

76
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,760
You remember Mr. Chuen?

77
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:02,203
Slept into a coma in 1984,
woke up last month-

78
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,634
Laaadies, wait the beef!

79
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:12,674
I'm just saying, let's keep the faith.

80
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:14,653
Yeah.

81
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:21,846
Don't let her put no more makeup on me.

82
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,304
I look like a streetwalker.

83
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,525
So, Bob, uhm...

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,983
How's Laverne doing?

85
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,850
She's still unresponsive.

86
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:41,940
Are you on call tonight or will
you be busy fighting Superman?

87
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,392
- You look like Lex Luthor.
- I got it.

88
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,349
- Sonia!
- Yes.

89
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,075
- We've got some super-secret news!
- Hit me!

90
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,717
- Sugarplum.
- They're scooping the baby out of me today.

91
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,513
- You guys, congrat--
- Don't say it.

92
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,482
<i>Congratu--</i>

93
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:00,440
Don't even think it!

94
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,779
<i>He's in my head. I love it!</i>

95
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,210
Only telling you this,
because we need a favor.

96
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,812
Anything, just three quick questions:
did you do this to your head

97
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:10,445
so that the baby would think
anybody looks like that,

98
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:13,079
can I be the godfather,
and why is this a secret?

99
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,450
I'm going to answer the first two
with the same sentence:

100
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:18,105
Stop making dumb jokes,
and it is a secret because

101
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,343
Jordan had pre-natal surgery for
a hydronephrosys,

102
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,546
so I wanna make sure everything's okay with
the kid before we start spreading the word.

103
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:26,845
You guys, your baby is going to be just fine.

104
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,887
Thanks, now all our fears are gone.

105
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,119
Here's what I need you to do.

106
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,056
<i>Oh my God, dr. Cox is letting me
into his inner circle.</i>

107
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,541
<i>He wants, no, he needs my help.</i>

108
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,831
<i>If you do this right, next stop: Godfather.</i>

109
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,124
<i>Hey, what did he say?</i>

110
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:42,429
We're all ready for you.

111
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,650
Can you manage that?

112
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,015
<i>Ask him to repeat it, nonono!</i>

113
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,911
<i>Then-then he will know you were not
listening, and will never trust you again.</i>

114
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:49,939
I'm on it, Perry.

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,586
What's going on, I mean...

116
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,008
You can't be a ghost, you're not dead!

117
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,394
- Damn right I'm not dead.
- Then why are you here?

118
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,385
Suggy, you're the one imagining me,
it's up to you to figure that out.

119
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:06,006
- Dr. Cox, nice head.
- Nice.

120
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,880
This maybe a strange question, but...

121
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,025
Have you ever had memory of someone
following you around,

122
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,143
kinda like... a ghost!

123
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:22,580
No, but then again, I'm a sane person.

124
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:23,972
Ok.

125
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:26,889
Liar.

126
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,284
Hi dr. Cox!

127
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,845
I got pregnant in heaven. Who
knew that could happen?

128
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:33,875
Come on.

129
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,212
<i>I figured dr. Burman,</i>

130
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,074
<i>the hospital audiologist, could help me.</i>

131
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:44,521
Hey, Ed. I read once that audiologists
can read lips, is that true?

132
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:47,621
Actually, yes. Suprisingly
easy to learn, if you just--

133
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,826
I don't need your lifestory, Ed.

134
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:53,387
Can you help me reconstruct what someone said if
I remember what their lips look like?

135
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:57,643
- I'll give it a shot.
- Ok. Let's remember his mouth.

136
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,863
Now, let me get in the character.

137
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,566
Hating the world, clenching my jaws.

138
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:14,109
Wishing I could love JD a little more.

139
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,778
Well, I think what he said was:

140
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,345
<i>Ouff! For a minute there,
I was in real trouble.</i>

141
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,749
<i>I would have to kiss being
Godfather goodbye.</i>

142
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:29,138
<i>Which reminds me that time
my Godfather kissed me goodbye.</i>

143
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,984
<i>He always said "Crumbs in a soul patch".</i>

144
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,451
<i>Wait, has he been talking that whole time?</i>

145
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,825
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

146
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:41,058
I said I think it's: "Pick up some film,
for my camera,"

147
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:42,522
Good work, Ed.

148
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,600
You know, she once told me,

149
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:50,338
I'd have a happy life. And...

150
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:53,538
she said it with a straight face.

151
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:59,421
You were the one woman I'd never do,
cause I respect you too much.

152
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,009
And you're kind of a big gal.
But if doing you right now could help,

153
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,625
- I would.
- I'd like to say something private.

154
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,891
- I love you.
- Ok. Yes, it's allright.

155
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,529
I probably should have  should
have said this to you before, but...

156
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,325
You always impressed me.
Your compassion, your faith...

157
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,357
and you didn't get mad at me
when I insisted that I should be

158
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,446
the lifeguard at your
above-ground pool party...

159
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,595
even after I made it painfully
obvious that I'm not a strong swimmer.

160
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:34,438
If you see your dog up there,
please tell him I'm sorry.

161
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,069
What are you doing?

162
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,742
I wanted to share a few words

163
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:44,090
before she passes through
the golden doors of Valhalla.

164
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,084
What now?

165
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:47,976
I converted to the Norse religion,
a few years ago.

166
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,485
Just made sense.

167
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,690
That's it, no more goodbyes, ok?

168
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,179
She's not getting any better, but she
is not getting any worst either.

169
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,005
No-more.

170
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:06,412
How d'you love it when
you get yourself so, girl.

171
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,660
Oh, there... here's my girl.

172
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,124
How was she? How's the baby?

173
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,980
We got your daughter into the NQ,
and her lungs are great.

174
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:24,523
Like we discussed she'll need another
surgery in a couple of moths, but all in all,

175
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,185
everything is better than we can hope for.

176
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,721
Listen up, we're not comfortable letting
people see our emotional moments,

177
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:32,204
so if you just... turn around
for a second, that'll be great.

178
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,168
Ok, we're good.

179
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:44,142
Ah, nurse Roberts...

180
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,164
You were always one of the good ones.

181
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,259
- What the hell?
- We did it once,

182
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:01,431
twice a month, years ago, before Mr. Roberts.

183
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,105
- Did I not tell you that?
- No!

184
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,353
He loved hitting some brown sugar.

185
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,446
That look only works on black guys.

186
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,730
Then why are you sporting it?

187
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,414
How did it go?

188
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,927
Everyone's-doing-well.

189
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,421
<i>Though you'd prefer to give him
a full body hug,</i>

190
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:29,374
<i>just go with the slight nod.</i>

191
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,626
<i>And now, the Cudagrow.</i>

192
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,139
I got you some film, for your camera.

193
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,055
Thanks, I guess.

194
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,387
Did you pick my son up at daycare?

195
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,489
<i>Pick up my son from daycare.</i>

196
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,423
<i>Dammit, it fits!</i>

197
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,668
- Takin' care of, Per-Per.
- That a boy.

198
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:51,433
<i>Luckily, I can walk and text simultaneously.</i>

199
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,397
It's gametime.

200
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:03,209
Hi, noobie. If this time you
tell the masses,

201
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,745
do me a favour try not to tear up.

202
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,721
<i>Sometimes, even the best news can be
disrupted by a stupid chart.</i>

203
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:11,324
Is that Laverne's latest CAT-scan?
How does it look?

204
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,963
<i>And when that chart has
the worst news of all,</i>

205
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,494
<i>there's only one thing left to do.</i>

206
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,375
Bye, Laverne.

207
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,803
That can't be good.

208
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:42,406
<i>Laverne was brain-dead, so when her family
decided to take her off life support</i>

209
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,738
<i>all we could do was to wait
for her body to give up.</i>

210
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,149
<i>I couldn't help to think at the first time
I have dealt with death and</i>

211
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,830
<i>how Laverne had been there for me.</i>

212
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,989
No way anyone could have called it,

213
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:55,478
- Anyhow you have to pronounce it.
- Why did anybody page me?

214
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,166
Could you just pronounce him so i go home?

215
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,973
You can finally go home Laverne.

216
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,516
Oh, he did not just say that.

217
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,350
Too cheesy.

218
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:11,866
Hey Carla, I can...

219
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:15,041
get someone to cover for you if you
wanna take some time to say goodbye.

220
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:16,887
I got stuff to do.

221
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:28,751
Per, I am drugged upon painkillers,

222
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:32,547
I've arranged my hair, I've got
that brand new picture of the baby,

223
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:36,017
I am ready for the flood of well-wishers.

224
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,831
Uhm, buttercup, this is not our child.

225
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,977
Oh, our still looks like a lizard.

226
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:47,184
I got this off the internet, I think it's
some baby that Luke Wilson had with a hooker.

227
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:48,670
Fantastic.

228
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,561
I'm gonna go and spread the word.

229
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,640
Thank you, squish-nose.

230
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,171
Ok, the fastest way to spread the news
is tell the guys in radiology.

231
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,140
Did you know how Joanne and Rhonda on:

232
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,608
"Bla-bla-bla-bla!

233
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:05,228
- Oh, that's Dr. Dorian, he's so hot!
- I agree. - No you don't, you mad!"

234
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,720
That's Rhonda, by the way.
Joanne, horse-face!

235
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,533
I'm not telling anyone that
my daugther has been born.

236
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,466
- But you just told Jordan that you gonna--
- Yeah, so that's what we call a lie,

237
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:18,492
or when you're married... communication.

238
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:22,396
Come on, noobie, you and I both know Laverne
is not gonna be around a whole lot longer,

239
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,608
and I know this reasoning
is about as rational as your parents

240
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:28,261
actually thinking they could
raise you as a boy, but...

241
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,467
I don't want the birth of my child
to be forever associated with her death.

242
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,763
That's why I'm not gonna tell anybody
anything until after she passes.

243
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:42,766
Now I... just gotta figure out how to stall Jordan.

244
00:14:43,128 --> 00:14:45,622
- I can help...
- Like you helped to pick up my son?

245
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:46,914
He got home, didn't he?

246
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,890
- Some say speed metal can be very soothing.
- Ahm.

247
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:07,754
Well, since I already know about it, 
why do we go in there, make a big show,

248
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:10,918
give her some JD's
razzle-dazzles in jazz hands,

249
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,707
that way she'll forget all about how no one's
come to congratulate on your arrival

250
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:16,448
little baby Jennifer Dylan.

251
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,125
- Why that name?
- I just think is pretty.

252
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,114
<i>- Ah.
- And she'd be JD forever.</i>

253
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:29,544
You know Laverne, if this was a horror
flick I'd be so scared that I was next.

254
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,048
Huh, they always kill the black folks off first.

255
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,199
Now, I'm not really worried about it, 'cause...

256
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,077
It's still the Snoop Dogg resident,
Leonard the security guard and...

257
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:46,000
You know when you think about it,
this is a white ass hospital,

258
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:57,171
I'm gonna miss you. So, you take care, ok?

259
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,539
Turk, Carla is really having hard time
with all this and I think she needs help.

260
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:10,935
Ok, let's go.

261
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:15,127
This is gonna suck so... since you are her
best friend, you should do all the talking.

262
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,975
Turk, you should do it.

263
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,806
Oh no, I'm just her husband,
you guys are way closer.

264
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:26,208
Would you just do me a favour and... go away?

265
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:31,992
I'm an extension of your psyche. All you have
to do is close your eyes and think me away.

266
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,034
Ok.

267
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,875
- I can see your crouching under the table.
- Damn.

268
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:48,834
Hey, uhm, baby? Laverne is getting weaker by the
minute we thought you might wanna come back up.

269
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,504
I don't know...

270
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:57,492
You know, Carla, when I was 12 years old
I had this math teacher, Mr. Crane.

271
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,293
Anyway, he used to give us
these pop quizzes all the time,

272
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:03,141
not about maths, there were
litterally quizzes about soda pops,

273
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:07,161
So once the question was:
"What was Mountain Dew's original name?"

274
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,868
So, I wrote my admiss and then my best friend
Sandy Marchamer teared off my paper

275
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:13,398
but it was  the wrong answer,
because it was a trick question.

276
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,461
Mountain Dew was always called Mountain Dew.

277
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:21,823
Although, little known fact, Mr.Pibb
originally called "Senor Brown water".

278
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,240
Th--the point is: Sandy got the answer wrong,

279
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,839
she failed the course and she had
to go to a dumb girl school.

280
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,952
I never... even got to sign her yearbook.

281
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,225
Ok, uhm, I'm just guessing,
but what I think Elliot's saying is

282
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,659
that you should probably say goodbye
to the people you care about

283
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,795
when you have the chance.

284
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,734
Yeah.

285
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:50,762
Maybe, that's why you're imaging me here,
because you don't wanna do that.

286
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,753
I'm just going to shut up.

287
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,832
<i>All right, you wanna seal the godfather deal,</i>

288
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,683
<i>Make Jordan feel like she's the first
woman that ever gave birth.</i>

289
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,933
<i>Congratulate hard and go home.</i>

290
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,498
Y-a-t'il une mere dans la maison?

291
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,809
That's French for
"is there a mama in da house?"

292
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:11,361
Wow, do you look hot for all what you
just got in! Can you believe it, Per?

293
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,394
Are you With me? You are, I know I am!

294
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:16,822
What's that smell? That's the
sweet scent of afterbirth.

295
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:20,657
Jordan, I'm so happy to be in your life
and these are for you.

296
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,429
<i>You're in the zone!</i>

297
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,245
<i>Now break at home with an emotional
voice crack to show the depth of your love!</i>

298
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:29,052
I am so happy for you.

299
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,033
<i>Bravo!</i>

300
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:35,062
When are the people I actually
give a crap about showing up?

301
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,209
You!

302
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:42,820
- I am officially... screwed.
- Don't swear it.

303
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,780
There's one more way I could stall.

304
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,400
And now, Shadow puppet theatre.

305
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:55,058
Wiff... wiff... wiff... I'm a dog!

306
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:57,826
- Lame!
- C'mon. Just getting started...

307
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,507
Gang! Places!

308
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,887
Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941.

309
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,430
It started as a peaceful day, and then...

310
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,034
Aggression from the Japanese!

311
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:16,168
- Pheeew! Ow, it's just totally unexpected!
- Phoom! Phoom!

312
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,918
- Paaaawng!Phooog!
- Ooow!

313
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:21,821
- I bite you, my friend!
- Ted!

314
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,385
There were no alligators in Pearl Harbor!

315
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,485
- Oh, man! Battelships are so boring!
- Back to work!

316
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:35,386
We can also do the battle of Gettysburg,
or the first act of "Miss Saigon".

317
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,293
What the hell am I gonna do?

318
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:41,765
<i>Unfortunately for Dr.Cox, that's when Elliot
walked by, and showcased her oddest talent.</i>

319
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:46,269
- Ssssomebody just had a baby.
- How d'you know?

320
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,666
My uterus is glowing.

321
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,821
My mom had an uterus...Ilived in it.

322
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,030
Oooh! Oh my god! It was Jordan, isn't it?

323
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,149
Listen carefully, Barbie--

324
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:04,332
- If you mention it to a sole soul help me--
- Save it.

325
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:08,689
Not even a killer track coupled to
that new psichopathic alien hand

326
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,679
could keep me from telling the world!
Congratulations! Oh, babe!

327
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,712
- Ooohh...
- Waaaah! Yes!

328
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:16,933
<i>And there it was.</i>

329
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,704
<i>The birth of Dr. Cox's baby would
forever be associated with Laverne's death.</i>

330
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,675
<i>And the next time Dr. Cox walked into the ICU</i>

331
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,792
<i>he'd be greeted by a series of sad faces.</i>

332
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:27,596
* People clap *

333
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:28,123
Hey, Bob.

334
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,855
- Hey, boy.
- Hey, Janitor.

335
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:35,804
- Congratulations!
- And for everyone:

336
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:39,472
in your faces! I knew it!
Tell'em, Perry. 'twas a long saga.

337
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,181
So, uhm...

338
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:42,928
How's she doin'?

339
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:44,965
She's hangin' on.

340
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:48,975
You jerk! Why didn't you tell us?

341
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,942
Well...

342
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,925
because we all love Laverne very much,

343
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,742
and I know this'll sound selfish and crazy, but...

344
00:20:57,512 --> 00:21:00,132
I didn't want everyone
thinking about her dying

345
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,386
everytime my daughter has a birthday party.

346
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:06,668
And byeveryone, I mean the few of you
I would actually invite to such an event.

347
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,395
Nope.

348
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,602
A baby is a blessing.

349
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,217
Besides, when it's time for something
to happen, you just gotta let it happen.

350
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,029
And, sometimes it takes a little while to realize, huh?

351
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:20,781
Yeah.

352
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:23,738
Big though.

353
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:25,785
<i>And that's when Carla knew what she had to do.</i>

354
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,029
Go on, girl.

355
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,292
You can do it.

356
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:48,835
{\an8} * Why do I have to fly *

357
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,380
Wow, I'm still not ready to do this.

358
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:55,633
* Carla sighs *

359
00:21:57,473 --> 00:22:00,901
It's gonna be so weird not
having you by my side every day.

360
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:05,248
Making fun of the doctors...

361
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:08,309
Goin' on and on about Jesus...

362
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,613
And I hope it's real, or you gonna be piiiissed...

363
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,102
Remember my first day?

364
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:21,520
When that patient came in
and started bleeding out on me?

365
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,469
I was so shocked I could barely move.

366
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:28,168
But you stood by my side.

367
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,459
And you guided me through it.

368
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,807
And then you did the most
amazing thing of all.

369
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,332
You made me laugh.

370
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:42,243
* Carla sighs *

371
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,337
For the last 15 years,
you've been my role model...

372
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,713
but most of all you've been my friend.

373
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,928
* Sighs along *

374
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:03,547
And I don't know what else to say, so...

375
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:07,856
I'm really, really gonna miss you.

376
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:15,903
* Sigh * Goodbye.

377
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,133
Come on, baby.

378
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,480
<i>You can ask any doctor,</i>

379
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,804
<i>sometimes it seems like patients just hang on</i>

380
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,095
<i>until everyone has a chance to say goodbye.</i>

381
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:45,733
Here, boys and girls.

382
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,438
- Thanks.
- Truth to be told, they

383
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,222
are on that guy.

384
00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:57,977
<i>Friends have a way of helping you move on.</i>

385
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:01,828
<i>Even if it's a simple changing of subject.</i>

386
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:03,602
Dr. Cox, I cannot wait

387
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:05,893
- to see that little baby of yours.
- Yeah.

388
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,061
Must be such a madhouse with everyone
there to see Jordan.

389
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:12,347
What?

390
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,271
I only told you guys,
and you guys are all...here.

391
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,449
Well, what's the worst that can happen, right?

392
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,515
They're probably just forming a line outside
to make sure they come in one by one.

393
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:28,797
Screw it. Y'know what?

394
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:33,118
- You're the godfather!
- YES! Yes! Yes! In your face!

395
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:36,724
Can you name her Jennifer Dylan?

396
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,325
Sure. What the hell?

397
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:45,578
<i>And finally, there was
only one thing left to say.</i>

398
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:47,690
To Laverne!
