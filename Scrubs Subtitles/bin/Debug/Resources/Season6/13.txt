1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,851
- Hey Grandpa, a little help.
- Here ya go, sport.

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,588
But call me grandpa again, and you
and I are going to play a little game

3
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,278
called "Hide the Wingtip".

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,509
There may be
a generational gap here, I'll explain.

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,422
The wingtip is my shoe,

6
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:19,527
the hiding place is your ass.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,724
Hi, Bob. That's why
I always save you a place.

8
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:26,695
You keep the riff-raff in check.

9
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:27,614
My pleasure.

10
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:31,032
Well, let's see
what's Enid packed for lunch today.

11
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,605
A stapler and a golf ball.

12
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:38,985
- She's not well.
- I'll trade you.

13
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:41,699
- My apple for your golf ball.
- Done.

14
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,592
Maggie, how long
has your foot been like that?

15
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,350
Nurse Turkelton,

16
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:53,471
I want you to take good care
of my friend Maggie here.

17
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,458
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.

18
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:59,876
- Name and insurance, please?
- Maggie Kent,

19
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,462
and... none.

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,160
All right, let's find a room.

21
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,437
<i>When a patient doesn't have any insurance
you have to work around the system.</i>

22
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:10,076
<i>First you have to find
someone who's recently died.</i>

23
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,032
Cool! Mr. Rabinowitz just kicked it.

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,451
Oh, don't worry.
He put his peep in an electrical socket.

25
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:18,015
You can't do that.

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,544
<i>Then you have to convince the morgue guy
to sit on the paperwoks</i>

27
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,294
<i>to let it seem that the bed stays open.</i>

28
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:25,273
<i>Deal!</i>

29
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,044
<i>Then you have to get the floor nurse
just to play along.</i>

30
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,144
Enjoy your kosher meal, Mr. Rabinowitz.

31
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,650
<i>Then you have to find the surgeon
to do the work pro-bono.</i>

32
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,215
Dude, I've had a pro bono like all morning.

33
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,639
Something might be wrong five.

34
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:43,359
I got this one.

35
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:45,850
<i>But most importantly
you cannot let any high rocks find out</i>

36
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,496
<i>that the patients aren't insured.</i>

37
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,187
<i>Even if they are the ones who
brought her here in the first place.</i>

38
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:55,072
Bob, I wanna thank you for doing all this
even though I don't have any...

39
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:56,540
Dr. Kelso, we need to talk to you.

40
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:58,956
What is it?

41
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,856
Ah, we wanna go somewhere with you.

42
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,783
- Ok. Where?
- A Spa.

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,585
- We'd like to get some massages.
- Mmhh.

44
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:10,291
Well, I know just the place.

45
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:13,938
Auhhh!

46
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,445
Right, now I got a crick on my neck.

47
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:21,838
We are gonna get a little graphic here.

48
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,897
So, you fellas might
wanna look the other way.

49
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,477
Or not. It's your choice.

50
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:28,907
Turk, why are you looking?

51
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:30,862
'Cause my neck cricked. I can't move.

52
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,423
Watch this, Turkelton.

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,983
She calls it the Shanghai Surprise!

54
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:36,509
Oh, God!

55
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:40,832
Ohhh!

62
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,407
Ok, Maggie,

63
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,485
as soon as your labs come back
we'll prep you for surgery.

64
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,781
You two are my guardian angels.

65
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,109
Hey, good morning, fellas!

66
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:08,910
- Hi sir, how are you? Lookin' good.
- It's good, how about you?

67
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:09,837
Why so awkward?

68
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,896
You never saw a colleague
get a happy ending before?

69
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,755
- No, not-not that happy.
- But thank you,

70
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:16,847
for including us.

71
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh, sorry, Barbie, wait just a second, eh...

72
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:20,792
I gotta tell you. You look...

73
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,205
well, down it all, you look great today.

74
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:25,906
Oh, thanks.
I started using that new facial cream

75
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,338
- made from baby foreskins.
- Ohhh!

76
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:30,544
But, I don't understand.
You haven't complimented me in six years.

77
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,824
- Why today?
- Well...

78
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,926
since you are a Private Practice Doctor

79
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:36,297
who went home yesterday at 5 leaving me yet

80
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,182
on high with your melanoma patient,

81
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,166
I just knew if I complimented you

82
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,244
sure shortly you'd look at me just

83
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,804
a here too long and then
this would happen.

84
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,789
- Uhh!
- Aaahhh!

85
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,425
Oh, you think you're funny?

86
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,489
I do, I always have,
ever since I was little. It's...

87
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,779
one of the reasons that I'm a winner.

88
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm in a hurry.

89
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,826
I promised one of my patients that I would
be at his first first day of drug counseling.

90
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,188
See? I got it right here.

91
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,172
Oh! Bar-boo! Give me a break.

92
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:07,331
Why, on God's name do you think
I'd care about anything that you wrote down?

93
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:08,998
You wouldn't.

94
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,781
- Ha!
- Nice!!!

95
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,207
Hey, can you believe
who the new drug counselor is?

96
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,789
I just want you all to know
that I came right where you are.

97
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,239
Only a couple of years ago
I was in this very hospital

98
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,280
scamming that nice doctor
over there for painkillers.

99
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:29,417
Can everyone say "Hi" to Dr. Reid?

100
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:31,789
Hi, Dr. Reid!

101
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:33,697
Hey, drug addicts!
What's up?

102
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,603
Girl, can you believe what they say
on these white-people magazines?

103
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:40,706
Look here.

104
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,648
This is a computer chip
that you put in your baby's foot

105
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,240
so you can track him,
like a baby low jack.

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,782
White people do the craziest things.

107
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,766
Like bumper stickers.

108
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,933
I don't give a damn what you brake for!

109
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,692
I know, white people! Phew!

110
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,019
No, my...my stepmom is one quarter Inuit,

111
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,156
so I'm...part Eskimo.

112
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:04,281
Anyway, small favour. I need your baby.

113
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,910
I'm getting in the baby broker
business. Nothing illecit.

114
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:10,356
I'm just hooking up folks that can't have babies
with folks that don't want babies.

115
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,152
You, leave.

116
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,861
You, give me that baby
little jack number.

117
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,199
Already tore it up.

118
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:22,645
- Oooh... hey!
- Hey,

119
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,885
where were you? We were supposed
to meet for breakfast.

120
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,866
My bad, I was hanging
out with J.D. and Rowdie,

121
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,278
when we decided to pull prank
like we used back in the day.

122
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:36,225
Here goes Ted... go, go, go!
Pull!

123
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:39,200
<i>Love you, I love you...</i>

124
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:41,651
<i>I love my...</i>

125
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,731
Ooh dog!

126
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:48,469
Ghost dog...

127
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,657
Oooh!

128
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:02,545
Calm down, people, we have
a backup generator.

129
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,015
Aah, thank God, I was just bluffing.

130
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,020
Won't be doing that again.

131
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,541
Ted, look at this budget!

132
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:18,292
Oh, God, have an option to make you pay
for every cent of that new transformer.

133
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:22,300
I'm telling you, sir. A lifeless ghost dog

134
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:26,110
glided in front of my car
wearing roller-skates.

135
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:30,443
If this is your way of trying
to make me feel guilty

136
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:33,972
about paving over that Indian
burial ground, it isn't going to work.

137
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,189
We needed the damn parking spaces.

138
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:41,250
Now, why in the hell are we
paying this much money for scrubs?

139
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:44,451
Maybe people are stealing them.

140
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,700
Now why would people be stealing scrubs?

141
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:55,963
Hey, mom. A guy tried to die on
me today, but I didn't let him.

142
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,010
I didn't let him!

143
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:02,742
<i>What a friend we have in Jesus...</i>

144
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,034
Excuse me guys, stealing scrubs here.

145
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:18,001
So, anyway, I've been an addicted
since I was 14,

146
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:21,400
then a year ago I realized it was
time to wake up and get sober.

147
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:25,110
- So you fell and just hit rock bottom?.
- No no no, I hit a cop.

148
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:31,053
Then, anyway, since I wasn't willing to do
that things, you know, you need to do in jail,

149
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:36,359
to get narcotics, at least not
enthusiastically, I... I got clean.

150
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,523
Name of the game: Raise your hand
if you're full of crap.

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,659
<i>Sam, if you don't raise your hand
you're going to lose the game.</i>

152
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,706
Come on man, you don't know how
hard it's been to stay strict.

153
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:50,057
Been there, brother.

154
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,042
- Aaaargh!
- Aaahh! Turk!

155
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,737
You know I hate that damn dog.

156
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,408
No, it's not Bald Black Doctor.

157
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,892
It's Haired Half-White-Half-Inuit Janitor.

158
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:12,066
And this... is the real Rowdie.

159
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,174
- Excuse me?!
- You recall that a couple of years ago

160
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,403
you lost him?

161
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,437
- Rough, rough...
- Oh!

162
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,645
You were panicked that your
husband was gonna find out,

163
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:24,712
so I sold my entire stuffed squirrel army,

164
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:27,812
exchanging it for Steven, an exact replica.

165
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:33,418
What you don't know is that I retraced
your steps that day, and I found Rowdie.

166
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,032
Now I think, if your husband knew that he'd
be loving a fake dead dog all this time,

167
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,554
he'd be very unhappy.

168
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,239
- You're a crazy person.
- Am I?!

169
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,455
Or am I a brilliant mastermind

170
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,233
who's waited two long years until
he needed something from you?!

171
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,690
And now that day has come.
Here's what I want.

172
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:55,671
I want your baby, we already
talked about that,

173
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,915
I want you to tell that new borderline
anorexic nurse to eat a sandwich.

174
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,606
And then to go salsa dancing with me.

175
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,159
Also I want you to teach me the salsa dance.

176
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,535
I want a pound of Frankincense,
mostly just to see what it is.

177
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:13,653
And lastly, I'm in a little bit of thief
with the main barista, down at coffeebucks,

178
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,157
he's nut about poisoning me,

179
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:18,452
so I'm gonna need you to be
my official beverage tester, yes?

180
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm just gonna confess everything to Turk.

181
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:24,828
- Hmm.
- Grrrr... No, easy boy.

182
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,555
We'll get her.

183
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,409
Why can't you just give Sam a break?

184
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,507
Look, the only thing Sam did was to go

185
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:37,052
from being a lying drug addict to being
a lying drug addict who works here.

186
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:41,643
People change. I knew this one migrant
worker from our horture, Ramon,

187
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:46,197
he used to say "I hate applesauce, it destroys
the interior. La manzana"

188
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:50,386
Manzana is spanish for apple, anyway, last
time I was home I asked how Ramon was doing.

189
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,757
Vice-president of Mart Applesauce, it's true...

190
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,123
Ramon Dalgado, look him upon the internet.

191
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:58,061
- Very well.
- Though, I made it up.

192
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,062
Point is people can change and you know it.

193
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,226
Nothing ever changes.

194
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,588
The Artist Formerly Known As Prince
is still just Prince,

195
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:09,344
my ex-wife is still pretty much my wife,

196
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,434
Grey's Anatomy always reps up
every episode...

197
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,184
some cheesy voiceover that ties together
all of the story line, which

198
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:19,279
incidentally is my least favourite device on television,

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,958
Noobie continuely will try to violate
my  no-touching policy...

200
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,503
Huh-ha!

201
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,650
- And Republicans will forever try to raise--
- Sneak hug!

202
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,273
Of course I would go kill him right now but
he actually just helped to prove my point.

203
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,435
This is gonna help, too.

204
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,448
There are ten orders of Percocet
missing from the pharmacy.

205
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,057
Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea

206
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,629
who I'm gonna give my
complementary urine test to!

207
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,662
So, how bad is it gonna be?

208
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:55,094
Well, you gonna lose that dead tissue,
but thanks to modern medicine

209
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,945
we're gonna keep most of your foot.

210
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:00,596
You won't believe how much worse
it would've been even a few years ago.

211
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,532
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- This might hurt it a little.

212
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:06,790
AAAHHH!!!

213
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,039
Look Milady, I know it stinks that we're
removing your foot

214
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,105
and plan to eat it tonight, at the healing
feast, but you wouldn't believe it

215
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,106
how much worse this would've been,
even a few years ago...

216
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,999
Bongo hongo bongo, boboh!

217
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,635
* Turk and JD are consulting *

218
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,447
Ohh! Oah?

219
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:34,774
Augh! Angah! Angah! Angah! Hough!

220
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,569
Hanga! Owhn!

221
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:42,343
<i>Onga banga tanga ranga,
gatanga batanga banga.</i>

222
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,564
I may have killed you, but I think
I was upset about it.

223
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:52,343
Listen up people, get around.

224
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,555
Not you, Mr. Miller, staff only.

225
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,639
All right, this is going to be very sample.

226
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:02,440
Whoever has been stealing scrubs
is going to raise their hand,

227
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:06,145
pay the hospital back, and be
immediately fired. Let's see him.

228
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:12,222
Ok, you people leave me no choice.

229
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:21,283
Heeh! Now you all have to wear scrubs
so hideous that no one would steal them.

230
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,950
You brought this on yourselves,
you thievy bastards.

231
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,377
- Turk, I need to talk to you about Rowdie.
- Hey, wait. Before you say anything,

232
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:29,780
sorry I skipped out on breakfast
to goof around with Rowdie.

233
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:34,342
But you've got to understand, Rowdie
is more than a dead toy to JD and me.

234
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:37,575
We got him together in college
and he's always been there.

235
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,626
- The key to the Salsa is passion.
- And...spin!

236
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,669
There were no drugs in Sam's bag,
and his ur-analysis came back clean.

237
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:55,143
Don't beat yourself up, bad guy,
I would have suspected me too.

238
00:12:57,142 --> 00:13:00,364
Now we should post a transcript for you:
"Nothing ever changes, Ruth,

239
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:03,209
in the cancer work for the chemio
patients is low, pick me up".

240
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,892
Oh, and FYI, I happen to like
the voiceovers on Grey's Anatomy.

241
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:08,911
Except when they are
really vague and generic.

242
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:14,199
<i>And so in the end, I knew what Elliot
said about the way things were</i>

243
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,453
and  for ever change the way
we all thought about.

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,325
Actually don't mind the new scrubs.

245
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:24,555
- Really makesmy outfit pop.
- "Guth agh gan gagh!"

246
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,454
Look, I know that you feel stupid
for falsely accusing Sam,

247
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,680
but it'll all goes away you
just apologize to him.

248
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:34,460
Weew! Ideal nut score, Barboo,
I wanted to surprise that gentleman

249
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,625
with something I thought he'd really
enjoy so I went out and got him

250
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:42,690
a brick of heroine shaped like a heart.
Now if I could just find him a funny card.

251
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:45,951
If you really thought he was still drug
addict you wouldn't let him counsel people.

252
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:49,533
Of course I would. Addicts make
the very best counselors

253
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:53,456
because they know just exactly what
druggies are going through, mainly because

254
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:59,352
and see if you can follow this, they're
currently going through it...too.

255
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:03,990
I don't care what you think,
I'm always gonna believe in people.

256
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:05,921
All the best with that, Barbidiot.

257
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,211
You brought these cocoa-colored
scrubs on yourselves, folks.

258
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,366
And thanks for playing along
with that hideous suit, Ted.

259
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:18,426
- Playing along with what, Sir?
- Nothing. Looking sharp.

260
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:19,856
Wow.

261
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:27,885
See? It's fine. Nobody's trying to poison y--

262
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:31,809
I knew it. She's gone.

263
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,180
Oh, boy! Someone's got to
tell to the black doctor.

264
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,763
I do not want that job.

265
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:40,345
- Naaah!!!
- Daaamn it! Zombie!

266
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,168
- I can't do this anymore. I'm out.
- What? Oh, no no, toots.

267
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,596
You're out when I say you're out.
I saw that, Frank.

268
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,112
Here's the deal.

269
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,028
When nobody's looking, we grab Steven

270
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,817
and make him go bye bye, then
there'll be only one dog left,

271
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,079
so when Lurch suddenly shows up
with the real Rowdie,

272
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,478
Turk will have to assume that he's
the one who stole him from the car.

273
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,328
- Got it?
- Whatever.

274
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,412
Lets do this.

275
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:13,220
Laverne Roberts!!!

276
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:17,702
Awh! Laverne?! I've got the keys right here!

277
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:24,688
'The hell! Tuna fish on a
sponge..She's getting closer!

278
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:27,796
- Hey, Bob!
- Hey, Maggie.

279
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:36,040
- I thought we'd have take care of that foot.
- Don't have insurance.

280
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,819
It's ok, I can get by.

281
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:43,852
<i>Everyone reacts differently to unpleasant
discoveries. Some people get angry.</i>

282
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:44,876
Save my seat.

283
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,702
<i>Others are admittedly a tad more dramatic.</i>

284
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,148
Oh my God he's gone...
I think we're gonna be sick!

285
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:53,018
I never got the chance
to tell that I loved him.

286
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:57,037
I mean, guys, I know all about bottoming out.

287
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:00,412
And it wasn't long ago that
I was out there on my knees,

288
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:02,422
praying to the God, just for help.

289
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:09,022
- God please! Please, God! God!
- God! Please God, Please help us!

290
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,622
- Please help me!
- God help!

291
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,809
That was weird. Uhm, okay, why
don't we call it a day, okay?

292
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,438
Oh, yes. very you, very you, very you.

293
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:25,882
Are-are you seriously doing the
cliched sarcastic slow clap?

294
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,812
It's that it's way too '990s.

295
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,615
Was a hell of a performance.

296
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:33,588
The attitude, the indignation, it was
damn near believeable, do you know that?

297
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:39,400
Honestly I-I don't really feel the need to
convince you of anything, but I would say

298
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:41,663
that if you're waiting to watch me slip,

299
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,888
then things are gonna get
really frustrating for you.

300
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,795
Let me tell you something, man.

301
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,584
This guy is amazing, okay?

302
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,917
He's unbelieveable.
To even get into his class,

303
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:55,288
You have to bring any drugs you
have at home, so you're not tempted.

304
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,452
Just to make sure I got this right...
You have to give your drugs...to him?

305
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:01,852
Absolutely, yeah.

306
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:05,598
Oh, that reminds me.
I found these in my dryer.

307
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:08,847
Tha-thank you, Lloyd.

308
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,669
He-he's doing very well.

309
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,396
Even I have to admit,
that pretty dark clever.

310
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:19,879
Thanks, I, uhm,

311
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,348
I came up with that when I
was shooting up with my scotch

312
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,546
in the back of it, so look at me now...crazy!

313
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,084
I'm gonna go and take this whole moment,

314
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:31,081
I'm gonna find Dr. Barbie,
and I'm going to drop it...

315
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,842
in...her face.

316
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:38,725
...troubles out fin--

317
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,034
Whoa-How! The boyRRs 'member me?

318
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,701
Gost dog! Ghost-dog!

319
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,152
You forced my hand.

320
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:47,964
Give it!

321
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,574
- How dare you steal our dog?
- Uh?

322
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,846
Sorry, you lose. Bye-bye.

323
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,954
Oh, and you should still have someone to
check your coffe before you drink it.

324
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:06,950
Sweet, huh? That's one for you, Frank.

325
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,618
Barbie, I have the most
exciting news to tell you.

326
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:14,800
What the hell, people, I just
saw Maggie Kent in the park.

327
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,345
- Why didn't we treat her?
- She has no insurance.

328
00:18:17,526 --> 00:18:19,132
Then why didn't we do what we always do?

329
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:22,315
Why didn't you fix it while I turn
my back and pretend not to notice?

330
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:24,333
- You know the dance.
-We used to.

331
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:27,122
But if you're gonna threaten to fire
us over taking a pair of scrubs,

332
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:29,995
why wouldn't we think you'd fire us
for treating an uninsured patient?

333
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,695
Then, if you take away the scrubs, you
take away the trust, and without trust,

334
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,292
everything falls apart.

335
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,436
And just like that, we had our old scrubs back.

336
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,163
I'm telling you guys, this could
gave been a much bigger moment.

337
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,398
Even though I was the only one
who knew how to embrace life,

338
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:57,365
We all left thinking about
how important trust is.

339
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,492
Dr.Cox let Elliot keep her trust
in humankind a while longer.

340
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,472
I, uhm, I just wanted to apologize,
Sam, for not believing...in...you.

341
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:11,459
Thanks.

342
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,824
- ...but why didn't you tell her?
- 'Cause this hospital

343
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:20,320
will eventually make her just as cynical
as everybody else in that dump,

344
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,587
does she need my help or not one.

345
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,068
By the way, do me a favor,
if you do use later,

346
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:26,993
don't drive.

347
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,670
- I'll take the bus, dude.
- Yeah.

348
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,881
Carla protected the trust that
we have in her by coming clean.

349
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,479
Anyway I should've told you guys,

350
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,492
I lost him back then, but hopefully
this will help you forgive me.

351
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,322
Woooow!

352
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:44,637
Look at those teddy next to each
other, two beautiful dead dogs.

353
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:46,762
And now, at least you can both have one.

354
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:50,189
I'm cool at keeping Steve, I mean,
we've got to know each other quite well.

355
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,532
How're we supposed to know who's who?

356
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,302
That's Steven, don't ask me how I know that.

357
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:00,959
As for Dr. Kelso, he knew that
trusting us again was probably foolish.

358
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:03,860
G'night, sir.

359
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,311
Still...it was worthy.

360
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:12,855
You want half of my sandwich?

361
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,165
Thank you Mrs. Swarris.

362
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:18,114
- It's Kent, Bob, Maggie--
- Shh.
