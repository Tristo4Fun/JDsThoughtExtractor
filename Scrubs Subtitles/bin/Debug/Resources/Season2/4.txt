1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,389
I can't stress enough how much
you gotta avoid the red meat.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,552
Cirrhosis is preventing your liver
from filtering out toxins,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,077
and you could become encephalopathic,
leading to a mental status change.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,435
I'm gonna start acting crazy
or something?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,432
You'll need a tinfoil hat
to hold in all your thoughts.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,592
I can still have a tiny bite
of my wife's <i>carne asada,</i> right?

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,240
- Well...
- <i>The greatest thing about Carla</i>

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,914
<i>is I always know I can count on her</i>
<i>to be the bad cop.</i>

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,831
What part of "no meat" don't you get?

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,673
- I just thought...
- Carla!

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,594
So if you don't listen to Dr Dorian,
you're gonna have to answer to me.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,955
- OK. lx-nay on the eat-may.
- That's right.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,679
<i>We're a team.</i>

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,753
- What?
- Eat-may sounds like eat me.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,434
<i>Of course, on some teams</i>
<i>there's gonna be friction.</i>

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,318
All right, we're done here.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,709
- Bonnie, you close.
- Damn.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,473
Don't be mad. Just be the good
little bee-atch you are

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,551
and wipe the sweat off my forehead.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,029
Look, don't say "bee-atch."
You can't pull it off.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,999
Interesting, being that you're
the queen mother of all...

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,550
Dr Wen, my forehead's
feeling a little misty.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,835
Dr Turk, are your hands broken?

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,229
No.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,471
- Here you go.
- That's nice.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,039
Bee-atch.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,957
<i>And some teams</i>
<i>never really seem to get together.</i>

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,679
- I'm so glad I caught you...
- And there it is again.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,318
That ringing in my ears.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,868
It's kind of an...
but more piercing.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,918
It's more of an...

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,116
She's trying to ask you a question.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,714
Now, you, you're more
of a low-pitched...

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,992
It's more masculine,
which, quite frankly, is surprising,

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,039
considering the source, but make
no mistake, oh, just equally annoying.

36
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,433
Luckily, though,
I know how to make the pain go away.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,637
- Much better.
- Can you believe that?

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,632
Every time we talk to him,
he goes off on a random tangent...

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,629
- ...you know?
- Clearly, we're on the same page.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,518
We're residents.
We should be treated like colleagues,

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,068
and I can't even get him to notice me.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,151
Oh, God.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,317
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,795
OK.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,591
Maybe if you wore your hair up...

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,188
What's up?

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,748
<i>Be careful here.</i>

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,115
<i>Don't give him anything.</i>

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,839
Nothing. What is up with you, man?

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,674
I always get this way in the fall.
Summer's gone, the days are shorter.

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,832
It just makes me feel so...
What's the word?

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,879
- Sad?
- Yes, that's it.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,475
I'm a janitor, so I couldn't
think of the word "sad."

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,915
I was going to say
"it makes me feel so mop."

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,276
- Let me explain. I...
- Go ahead. I'm mopping.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,432
- Maybe I shouldn't bother.
- Maybe you mopn't.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,512
<i>I guess after a while,</i>
<i>you just stop being surprised by people.</i>

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,831
Yeah, I'm going to be needing a room.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,514
Who can say no
to 49-cent cheeseburgers?

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,229
Tack on the medicine, your room,
and pumping your stomach,

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,108
and that 49-cent cheeseburger's
in the neighbourhood of $1,300.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,634
- See, that's how they get you.
- That's right.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,517
- Carla, your brother called.
- Cool.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,592
- You have a brother?
- That's my pet name for Turk.

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,558
You know, cos he's mine,
and he's a black man, my brother.

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,757
That is adorable.
Think he'd mind if I call him that too?

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,673
- JD, I was kidding.
- I know.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,115
But I'm still gonna ask.

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,475
So how come I know nothing
about your family?

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,269
I don't know. I'm just not big
on sharing my personal life with people.

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,113
But you know everything about me.

72
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,589
You even know I have them
switch Lauren's shifts

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,477
so we always end up working together.

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,152
- I didn't know that.
- You do now.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,552
- Because I'm sharing with you.
- OK, I'm leaving now.

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,756
- Well...
- Another Friday night?

77
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,479
- That's three in a row!
- I know. It's so unfair.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,676
I'm mad about it.

79
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,514
Bonnie is killing me. I cannot beat
this woman no matter what I try.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,592
- She's like a ninja, but worse.
- Nothing's worse than a ninja.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,716
They're masters
of every style of combat.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,156
Can we please talk about something
other than Bonnie?

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,071
You should give Bonnie a break.

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,310
It's really hard being
a woman around here.

85
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,709
You walk through walls
and nobody notices you.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,394
Not entirely unlike a ninja.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,311
Whatever. I'm out.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,436
Catch you later, my brother.

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,469
- I'll holler.
- He said "holler."

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,272
Mr Tillman's results are back.
It's bad.

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,670
Dammit, Laverne,
why can't I ever be the one dying?

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,752
- I don't know.
- It was rhetorical.

93
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,435
Tell Mrs Tillman I'll be right out.
That would be terrific.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,273
- Mr Tillman is my patient too.
- He is?

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,794
I was in the room with you
this morning, remember?

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,029
No.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,391
Well, I was. Anyway, if you want,
I could talk to his wife.

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,789
Because I just really enjoy
that kind of stuff.

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,077
Wait a minute. Are you actually
saying you enjoy telling people

100
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,879
their spouses are going to die?

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,349
Yep. I mean,
I know that sounds a little bit weird,

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,795
but I just really like being there
for people.

103
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,713
It's kind of why I became a doctor
in the first place.

104
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,793
Well, it's nice to know
where the magic began.

105
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,279
There you go.

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,070
So, how are my girls today?
Fantastic. Listen...

107
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,799
If you're here to do one of your
"How are my girls today,

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,952
now let me tell you some things
you don't want to hear" routines,

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,554
I'm in a mood, so it's probably
in your best interest

110
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,471
to make up some lame excuse and leave.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,473
Young lady,
I will not be spoken to like that.

112
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,634
Luckily for you, I have to go see
Miss Fitzstrafoler.

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,599
- Attaboy.
- Rough day, huh?

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,309
Well, maybe it would help
to share with someone.

115
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,678
OK, you want in?
You want me to open up?

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,230
- I think I can handle it.
- Fine.

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,914
I don't like the way I look,
I don't like the way I think,

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,991
or the way I feel
about how I look and think.

119
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,753
I have too much hair,
my boobs are too low,

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,035
my butt is too big,
and I am too short.

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,033
Plus, I woke up and cried because
I thought I was getting wrinkles,

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,954
but it turns out I just fell asleep
on Turk's corduroy pants.

123
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,998
There. Now you think
I'm the craziest woman here.

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,318
Dr Cox let me tell a woman
that her husband's dying.

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,592
No, I don't.

126
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,229
Huh. So I'm doing
a nissen gastric fundoplication,

127
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,836
and you're doing
yet another appendectomy.

128
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,878
- How fun for you.
- You call that smack talk?

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,428
You should ask how it feels
to be so far below you

130
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,511
I wouldn't be able to read
"Suck it, Turk"

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,956
if you wrote it
on the bottom of your shoe.

132
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,270
OK. How does that feel?

133
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,918
- Damn.
- Doctors.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,434
Something I've taken
great pride in over the years

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,999
is Sacred Heart's involvement

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,719
in the esteemed "Doctors
Without Borders" programme.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,430
Now, every year I single out
the most qualified surgical resident

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,637
to accompany me
to Mexico for a weekend.

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,429
- Anyway, I've made my decision.
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,479
You haven't lived
until you've tasted El Todd's guac.

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,074
Dr Turk, pack your bag.

142
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,872
- Shove it, Turk!
- I'm gonna shove it,

143
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,679
and love it,
and dance around above it.

144
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,194
<i>Hey, shove it, and love it</i>

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,157
<i>And dance around above it</i>
Come on.

146
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,869
You see,
that's what's really bothering me.

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,713
What? Turk and Bonnie?
They hate each other.

148
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,837
Then why's he doing his
"You're getting a piece of this" dance?

149
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,559
He's not. That's his
"ln your face" dance.

150
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,949
Or it's his
"There's a sale on lotion" dance.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,917
I don't know.
He's got so many dances.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,197
Please, they might as well
be naked. Slut.

153
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,592
Carla. Trust me, there's no way
that he's cheating on you.

154
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,593
Yeah, you're probably right.

155
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,830
Wait, that's it?
You were just freaking out.

156
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,229
Hey, you wanted in.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,399
<i>Crazy.</i>

158
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,432
- Barbie.
- Yessie?

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,798
- How'd it go with Mrs Tillman?
- It was awesome.

160
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,791
It's not possessed.

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,189
- It's for sitting.
- Excuse me?

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,919
For God's sake, you must park it.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,319
Of course,
what we generally do now is eat. Eat.

164
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,751
I can't. I'm too nervous.

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,509
Christopher.

166
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,353
Sorry, sir. I just can't believe
Kelso chose me.

167
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,078
Yeah, me neither.

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,913
- I told him to take Bonnie.
- So, then, why'd he pick me?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,073
Among all the surgery residents, what's
the difference between you, Bonnie,

170
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,594
Todd, Steve, Erik, and Vijay?

171
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,035
- First of all, she's a...
- There it is.

172
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,712
- Wait. Because she...
- Yep.

173
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,155
- She?
- Exactly.

174
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,791
It's because she's a woman. Damn!

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,197
Fork. Me can't eat soup!

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,469
Look, I don't think you're stupid, OK?

177
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,596
Your job requires a lot of know-how.

178
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,990
It's not like you're ladling out
sloppy joes or something.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,197
You know, my uncle
was a "joer." Yeah.

180
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,551
Troy, let me fill you in on this guy.

181
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,232
JD.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,276
Oh, thank God.

183
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,999
<i>A lot happens in the cafeteria.</i>

184
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,833
<i>Whether you've accidentally</i>
<i>just stolen your lunch,</i>

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,992
<i>or you've finally gotten</i>
<i>someone to notice you.</i>

186
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,390
<i>Or you've connected with a friend</i>
<i>on a level you didn't know you could.</i>

187
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,029
<i>The cafeteria is just a happy place.</i>

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,269
What's wrong with him?

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,352
I'm only going to Mexico
cos Bonnie's not a guy.

190
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,793
I'm sorry, baby.

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,474
I can't believe you think
I got a thing for her.

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,152
<i>Oh, no.</i>

193
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,276
Who told you that?

194
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,238
JD told you that?

195
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,231
When did you guys learn sign language?

196
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,069
Night classes?
Wait, when did I learn sign language?

197
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,358
JD said you're a big old can of crazy.

198
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,479
A little can. A very tiny, small can.

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,632
No, you said "big can".

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,068
Mr Hogan, I've come up
with a little mantra for you.

201
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,720
- Hit me.
- "lf meat is your treat,

202
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,678
your oesophageal varices
will bleed into your intestines,

203
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,796
leading to a horrible, horrible death."

204
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,348
- Catchy.
- Say it over and over again.

205
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,591
Horrible, horrible death.

206
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,272
<i>OK, you can fix this.</i>

207
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,396
Carla, look,
I messed up and I'm so sorry.

208
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,472
Bambi, we're good, OK? We're pals.

209
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,549
Oh, thank you.

210
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,029
You think it's funny
to switch people's shifts?

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,838
Bye, pal.

212
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,434
I missed my baby's first steps.

213
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,672
I'm so sorry.
Does this mean you're married?

214
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,672
- Can I bother you for a second?
- Based on history, I'd say yes.

215
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,478
I know Dr Wen recommended Bonnie.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,269
I chose you over that nice young lady
because we're going to be moving around.

217
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,316
I can't be pulling over
every two minutes

218
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,039
for pee-pee stops and nylons
that come in plastic eggs.

219
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,714
Dr Kelso, don't you think
that's a little sexist?

220
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,233
I don't know, sport.

221
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,118
Is it sexist
to hold the door for a woman?

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,715
Is it sexist to keep the pretty nurses
and unload a few uggos?

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,395
The rules have changed so much,
I just can't keep up.

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,597
Tell you what, let's stop jiggling
each other's marbles.

225
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,672
You decide who should go.
That way, when you choose yourself,

226
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,309
I won't have to deal
with all this horrible guilt.

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,877
- Dr Cox!
- Jeez, Edith.

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,598
Hi.

229
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,358
This chair won't pull out.

230
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,830
Maybe that's because
my ankles are wrapped around it.

231
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,593
Look, I actually need some "me time."

232
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,789
- Yeah.
- OK.

233
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,077
I just wanted to say if you had
any other bad-news situations,

234
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,196
I would gladly handle them for you.

235
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,919
- Really?
- Gladly.

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,869
Well, welcome aboard.

237
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,674
Why would you get turkey
when there's egg salad?

238
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,990
Dude, there's no egg salad today.

239
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,593
You missed a spot.

240
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,359
- So we're even, right?
- Even?

241
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,271
I told a nurse you switched her shift.

242
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,157
You babbled all my crazy to the person

243
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,231
I plan on spending
the rest of my life with.

244
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,232
I could spend the rest of my
life with Lauren, or her tushie.

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,073
I just want to wash it. Is that weird?

246
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,515
- You think this is funny?
- Come on.

247
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,876
I told you how hard it is for me
to let my guard down.

248
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,396
And that quick you burn me.

249
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,675
- Never again.
- Well, don't walk away.

250
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,671
Carla, come on.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,037
Bonnie, I found out that Dr Wen
actually recommended you

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,554
for that trip to Mexico.

253
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,359
I'm sure you know how hard it is
for me to admit that to you,

254
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,477
so I was hoping that we can use this
as an opportunity

255
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,199
to repair our relationship.

256
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,191
What do you say?

257
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,558
Oh, my God. OK, fine.
Look, you go to Mexico, OK?

258
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,438
And by the way, <i>dolor en el asno</i>
means "pain in the ass."

259
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,193
I thought it would help you
when you introduce yourself.

260
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,350
I don't want your charity.

261
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,635
You go, and every second
you're down there,

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,711
I want you to think
about how I kick your ass

263
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,349
up and down these halls all day long.

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,557
Now, where was I?

265
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,191
Oh, yeah.

266
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,998
There you go, prom queen.

267
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,150
There is some really tragic stuff
in there,

268
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,356
so, you know, go nuts.

269
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,238
All of these are your patients?

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,788
No. But when word got out
about your little offer,

271
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,677
a bunch of other docs wanted in.

272
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,354
Oh, great. More for me.

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,675
I'm afraid you have hepatitis.

274
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,511
Meningitis.

275
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,152
Esophogeo-gastro-duodeno-colitis.

276
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,949
Yes, it's like being blind in one eye...

277
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,634
except you'll be blind in both.

278
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,431
I'm really sorry.

279
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,909
There's nothing more
that we can do.

280
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,669
Hello! We can hear you! Hello!

281
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,320
- Why won't it stop ringing?
- Hello!

282
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,278
- For the love of God, hello!
- All right, look.

283
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,318
OK, I never meant to insinuate
you guys were stupid, all right?

284
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,868
Everyone knows
you're a hundred times smarter

285
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,155
than the jackasses
that run this place.

286
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,835
- Is that so, sport?
- No, sir. It's not so.

287
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,638
Would you just go ahead
and answer it already? Hello?

288
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,836
Hello?

289
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,110
Hey, take that, smart guy.

290
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,839
Troy, that's not how we do it.

291
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,356
- Mr Hogan, what the hell?
- What would you do

292
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,432
if your five-year-old begged you
to have a bite of his dinner?

293
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,556
- You had two dozen ribs.
- I know.

294
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,279
- I don't even have a kid.
- That's it. I've had enough.

295
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,715
- This is ridiculous.
- Will you lay off Mr Hogan?

296
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,189
So he made a mistake.
People make mistakes.

297
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,953
It wouldn't hurt you to cut 'em
some slack once in a while.

298
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,996
- Thanks, man.
- This isn't about you.

299
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,638
Don't eat meat. Carla.

300
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,553
Every time you screwed up with me,
I've let you off the hook.

301
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,598
When have I ever screwed up with you?

302
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,955
OK, never, but we both know
that if you ever did,

303
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,758
I would give you a break.

304
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,116
Now, let's see how you like it
when I walk away from you.

305
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,710
Actually, I need to go this way.

306
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,237
Right the first time.

307
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,874
- Awesome.
- You're gonna love this one.

308
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,794
25-year-old woman, dancer, actually.
Well, not anymore.

309
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,553
We had to take both of her legs.
Bilateral gangrene.

310
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,949
And seeing as her husband
recently passed away,

311
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,076
and her insurance at the dancers' union

312
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,754
probably is not going to cover it,
you should tell her

313
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,638
she won't be able to stay
here with us for her rehab.

314
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,598
What room is she in?

315
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,514
There is no room.
In fact, in the history of medicine,

316
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,876
there's never actually been
a patient that depressing.

317
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,712
I made her up!
Come on, now, Barbie.

318
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,598
Keep going down this road,
you're gonna go up to the roof

319
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,272
and jump the hell off.

320
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,191
Mind you, it's only five stories high,

321
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,317
so you'll just wind up back down here,
where I will treat you.

322
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,391
Then I'll be forced
to jump off the roof,

323
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,358
which, as I was suggesting to you,
is only five stories high.

324
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,115
And are you starting to see
a pattern forming here?

325
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,714
I just wanted to be colleagues.

326
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,997
Barbie, as long as you stay
and work at this hospital,

327
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,071
I'm always gonna be your superior.

328
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,991
That's just the way it goes.

329
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,072
Don't get me wrong,
you can keep trying to connect with me.

330
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,311
I mean, hell,
you're so damn entertaining,

331
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,470
you just might make some headway.

332
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,835
But still, you might be better served,

333
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,754
and this is a crazy notion,
if you could stop worrying so much

334
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,594
about who does
and doesn't notice you.

335
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,750
Even for a second.

336
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,229
That'd be good.

337
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,276
That'd be real good.

338
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,272
<i>I think every day</i>
<i>is made up of tiny little tests.</i>

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,831
<i>Some are tests of character.</i>

340
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,275
<i>Some are tests of fortitude.</i>

341
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,271
<i>Others are tests of friendship.</i>

342
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,992
- I spoke to my brother today.
- Really?

343
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,309
He's having some problems.

344
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,198
<i>And if you're lucky,</i>
<i>when it really matters,</i>

345
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,511
<i>you'll pass with flying colours.</i>

346
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,951
<i>Hola,</i> K-Dog.

347
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,996
Yeah! Full bar!

348
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,875
Take us to Mexico!

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
