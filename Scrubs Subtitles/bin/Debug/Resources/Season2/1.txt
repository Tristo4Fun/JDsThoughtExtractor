00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:06,907
<i>Yesterday seemed like it would be</i>
<i>a good day. Then it happened.</i>

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:09,834
- Hey, everyone.
- Brace yourself, Newbie.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,231
Carla, my ex-husband
is in love with you. It's true.

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,755
Ask you boyfriend.
He and Perry talk about it all the time.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:22,156
And, Bob, when are you
going to tell Perry that that promotion

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,914
you're making him jump through hoops for
was filled months ago?

7
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,876
Which brings us to Twinkie.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,315
If you don't have the courage
to tell your colleague, Dr Dorian,

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,436
you're still crazy about him,
I'm gonna do it for you.

10
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:36,157
That's what friends do.

11
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:41,511
And finally, Perry. You are not gonna
believe what happened

12
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,794
the first time
I met your protégé here.

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,995
No!

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,752
I slept with him. And it was good.

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,592
Bye.

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,830
<i>Call it wishful thinking,</i>
<i>but I couldn't shake this feeling</i>

17
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,797
<i>that this was nothing more</i>
<i>than a very, very bad dream.</i>

18
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,196
- Good morning, tiger.
- <i>Of course, I've been wrong before.</i>

19
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,315
You let a woman
kick you out of your bed?

20
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,355
Why are you so cranky
in the mornings?

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,397
This is unacceptable.
You said we'd sleep head to foot.

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,788
The naughty bits
are still in the middle.

23
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,791
But with the head to foot alignment,
they can't lock in.

24
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,633
- Could you be more homophobic?
- I'm not.

25
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,114
Ready to go?

26
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,878
Morning, boy.

27
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,588
I can't remember the last time
I was in this foul a mood.

28
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,351
- Rowdy, no.
- Is that supposed to cheer me up?

29
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,748
Who would laugh at that?

30
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:40,070
Yeah, Rowdy, hit that!

31
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,719
I'm outta here.

32
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,391
Babe...

33
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,675
I hate it that everything's
so messed up between all of us.

34
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,876
Well, just remember what I said
to you this morning in bed.

35
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,190
I had shoes on.
It would've been impossible to lock in.

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,359
Everything's gonna be fine, OK?
Just be cool.

37
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,634
- I'm cool, I'm cool.
- Two.

38
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,112
<i>What?</i>

39
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,357
Babe, come on. Where you going?

40
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,477
Oh, God.

41
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,470
Just keep it down.

42
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,552
Clear.

43
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,317
Hey, Elliot.

44
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,271
Nighty-night.

45
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,915
<i>I just wish one of my relationships</i>
<i>could be back to normal.</i>

46
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,954
Looks like someone switched
to big-boy pants a little too soon.

47
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,156
That's very clever.
It looks like I wet myself.

48
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,628
Do you actually think that's funny?

49
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,438
Yeah.

50
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,672
<i>Good God, that's cold.</i>

51
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,993
<i>Life in a hospital</i>
<i>is made up of highs and lows.</i>

52
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,912
<i>For instance, my spare pair</i>
<i>of scrubs doesn't match,</i>

53
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,914
<i>but I put my underwear in the microwave</i>
<i>to dry them off and they feel good!</i>

54
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,309
- What are you smiling at?
- Can I have Mr Buckley's chart?

55
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,711
No problem. I keep it right down there
in the "get it yourself" file.

56
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,274
Bob, I've been thinking about
all the times you've manipulated me

57
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,318
and toyed with me, and well, I can't
help but recall that children's fable

58
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,355
about the race between the tortoise

59
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,909
and the pain-in-the-ass
chief of medicine that everybody hates.

60
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,274
The chief of medicine
that everybody hates

61
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,511
kept running in front of the tortoise
and taunting him, but at the end...

62
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,671
Oh, gosh,
I'm sure you remember what happened.

63
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,354
The tortoise bit clean through
the chief of medicine's calf muscle,

64
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,352
dragged him to the ground where he
and the other turtles devoured him alive

65
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,191
there on the racetrack.

66
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,555
It's a disturbing children's book,
Bob, I know,

67
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,951
but it's one that's stuck with me
nonetheless.

68
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,073
I beg your pardon.

69
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,629
That's the sound
of all the bees in your bonnet.

70
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:06,110
And even though I could give a rat's
ass, I still think it's a pretty sound.

71
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,516
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>it was my turn to face the music.</i>

72
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:18,719
<i>Steady now. Be brave. Don't cry.</i>

73
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,871
- Good morning.
- <i>What the hell?</i>

74
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,677
Dr Dorian.

75
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,398
- Here you go, whizz kid.
- Is that my new nickname?

76
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,154
I thought people would call me that
in high school when I was in <i>The Wiz.</i>

77
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,151
It was a hip version
of <i>The Wizard of O Z.</i>

78
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,912
Nipsey Russell played the Tin Man.

79
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,193
Remember that? No?

80
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,749
Kids can be mean and everyone
just started calling me Dorothy.

81
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,307
High school was hard.

82
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,152
I'm sorry, sport.
I was thinking about soup.

83
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:53,915
Now, Mr Zerbo was admitted with
a high fever and suspected meningitis.

84
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,150
But the head CT and
the lumbar puncture came back negative.

85
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,831
I have a full patient load.

86
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,275
You can't drop this guy on me
and expect me to make him a priority.

87
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,112
Want me to say "ta-dah"
so it seems more like a trick?

88
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,315
Mr Zerbo is a major hospital benefactor

89
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,517
and, by golly, it's a lot harder to
write a big, fat cheque if you're dead.

90
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,591
Neurology, rheumatology, haematology...

91
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:17,955
He's been to every service
in the hospital. What shall I do?

92
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,394
- I hope it's navy bean today.
- Dr Kelso.

93
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,428
Gee, sport, stop whining, find out
what's wrong with him, and treat it.

94
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,512
Or you can be damn sure I'm gonna
give you something to whine about.

95
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,591
Fine. After all, I'm the whizz kid.

96
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,953
You are now.

97
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,559
Ladies, now that the Todd is a resident,

98
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,949
he wants to clear things up
so you don't have to wonder any more.

99
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,635
Yes, yes, no, yes,
no and yes, if I've been drinking.

100
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,552
- Come here, Wonder Bread.
- What's up, doll?

101
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,358
If you ever get this close again,
I will end you.

102
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,795
I'm changing you to a yes
because you're feisty.

103
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,516
- Carla, I'm sorry.
- For him? It's not your fault.

104
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,677
I'm talking about us.
I'm sorry for what I did wrong.

105
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,717
- Which was?
- You know.

106
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:11,233
See? You don't even realise
why I'm upset.

107
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,550
- Why are you smiling?
- Because I set your ass up.

108
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,188
Baby, I should've told you
how Cox felt about you,

109
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,349
and I was wrong to talk
behind your back,

110
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,954
which is a violation of the trust
our relationship is based on.

111
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,518
That is why I'm sorry.

112
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,148
- My boy's got mad apologizing skills.
- Todd, not now!

113
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,957
You can't point out the obvious,
you have to go deeper.

114
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,157
Todd, if you say, "That's what
she said," I will brain you.

115
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:41,278
Now, come on, baby, connect with me.
Why am I really upset?

116
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,471
I'm gonna stick with violation of trust.
Final answer.

117
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
Yeah, right.

118
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,553
You know,
I got half a mind to ask her out.

119
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,836
Too soon?

120
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:03,998
Well, thanks for the loaners, Chet.

121
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,956
Don't stain 'em.

122
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,633
<i>Once you're a resident,</i>
<i>you get a decent locker.</i>

123
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,916
<i>Still, it's a co-ed room,</i>
<i>so if you need to change...</i>

124
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,593
<i>...you do it fast.</i>

125
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,273
That was, like,
some sort of record or something.

126
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,553
<i>Hello...</i>

127
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,949
Sorry, Mom. It's gotten awkward
with this guy I was seeing.

128
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,793
And... Yes, Mom...
Yay! I'm straight.

129
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,667
Look, I don't know what to do. Every
time I see him, I get so embarrassed.

130
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,391
And... lonely, and mortified, and
I guess I was hoping that you could...

131
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,595
About 115 pounds.

132
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:44,116
Phen-phen kills people, Mom.

133
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:48,397
Because I'm a doctor.
That's how I know.

134
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,030
- You look pretty.
- Don't even start.

135
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,394
- You look horrible?
- I look fantastic.

136
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,949
And that's starting.
I said not to start. Laverne?

137
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,950
That's what she said.

138
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,509
That's "don't start" in Spanish.

139
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,627
<i>I planned to avoid Dr Cox all day,</i>
<i>but I needed his help.</i>

140
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:12,187
I have this patient,
Mr Zerbo, I can't quite...

141
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,149
<i>Maybe he just decided</i>
<i>to let the whole ex-wife thing go.</i>

142
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,309
- Auto-immune serologies?
- Negative.

143
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,072
<i>Then again, maybe</i>
<i>he's letting me stew for a while.</i>

144
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,309
- Bone marrow biopsy?
- Negative.

145
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,959
<i>What kind of man</i>
<i>tortures people like this?</i>

146
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,348
'Fraid you got yourself a toughie.

147
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,714
Fine, I'm sorry I slept
with your ex-wife.

148
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,998
I think I'll sit back down.

149
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,478
It was an accident.

150
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,108
Look, first of all, it's not like
you tripped and fell into her.

151
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,396
And then out of her
and then into her again.

152
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,312
And second, you know
I don't want to talk about this.

153
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,392
I don't want to know where
you did it or even how it was.

154
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,947
A little scary. Sorry, jitters.

155
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,075
<i>Here come the fireworks.</i>

156
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,038
Look, I know you didn't have
any idea who she was,

157
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,758
and understand why
you were too nervous to tell me.

158
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,514
What do you say we leave it at that?
I forgive you. You are forgiven.

159
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,590
OK?

160
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,273
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Damn.

161
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,190
<i>Hospitals aren't as big as you think.</i>
<i>Eventually, you run into everyone.</i>

162
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,268
Hey, Elliot.

163
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:28,634
I'm not hiding, I was just looking
for my... You, know, the...

164
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:31,074
I was... looking for my dignity.

165
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,390
- Did you find it?
- No.

166
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,230
I must've left it at college.

167
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,675
<i>Oh, for God's sakes,</i>
<i>would you throw her a rope?</i>

168
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,717
I have no idea how to treat
this patient. Help me out.

169
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,394
<i>Now, she's in a really awkward place,</i>
<i>so just be sensitive.</i>

170
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,868
- I think we should sex each other.
- I'm sorry?

171
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,157
Just hear me out. Our relationship
ended so quickly. Maybe too quickly.

172
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:58,834
And now there's these feelings
floating around

173
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,515
and I feel like we'll always regret it
if we don't see if they lead somewhere.

174
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,956
What do you think?

175
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,031
I can't believe how weird
it feels to be back here again.

176
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:14,032
Yeah, but it seems so right.

177
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,350
If Carla's so mad, why doesn't she
just crash at her own place?

178
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,748
Oh, she is back at her place.

179
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,830
What are you talking about, Willis?

180
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,309
That's pretty funny.
We should make that one of our things.

181
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,549
That's stupid.

182
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,474
I think I'd really panic
if she went back to her place.

183
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,868
JD, this sucks.

184
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,350
Yeah, you know what's weird, though?
Dr Cox and I are pretty vegan kosher.

185
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,270
- He hasn't yelled at you?
- No.

186
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,954
This guy screamed on you for 20 minutes
for dropping a thermometer,

187
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,872
and hasn't raised his voice
about you and his ex-wife?

188
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,156
- Uh-uh.
- I don't get that guy.

189
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,868
<i>And that's when I realised something.</i>

190
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,152
- Where you been? I paged you twice.
- I must've misplaced my pager.

191
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,993
<i>The reason Dr Cox</i>
<i>wasn't yelling at me like he used to...</i>

192
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,798
You probably ought
to try and find that.

193
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>...he didn't care about me any more.</i>

194
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,714
Yeah, that's a leaky o-ring.

195
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,678
I can fix her,
but I don't got the parts in stock.

196
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,478
We need an o-ring down there.

197
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,914
That's entertainment.

198
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,473
<i>Standing there, I couldn't help thinking</i>
<i>about the way things used to be.</i>

199
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,436
<i>Don't forget, Felicia, if you...</i>

200
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,557
Son, you really ought
to buy that thing dinner first.

201
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,956
<i>It wasn't just me and Dr Cox</i>
<i>who weren't getting along.</i>

202
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,593
<i>Everyone was just drifting</i>
<i>through the halls.</i>

203
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,115
<i>Each one of us acting like</i>
<i>the others didn't exist.</i>

204
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,227
<i>That's when I decided to get pro-active,</i>
<i>and I knew just where to start.</i>

205
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,150
<i>What the bejesus?</i>

206
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,833
- Hello, boys.
- What the hell are you doing?

207
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,275
This is how the Todd
gets his self-esteem on.

208
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,077
Do these help?

209
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,152
Uncool! You look totally hot,
mirror Todd.

210
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,713
I think we should talk
about the sexual tension.

211
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,596
There is no sexual tension, OK?

212
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,708
Just go ahead and look
before your neck snaps.

213
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,587
- Awesome.
- JD, the problem is this place.

214
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,308
When we broke up, I had to see you
the next day. And the next day.

215
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,677
I never got any distance from the
relationship. I never got to move on.

216
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,511
And the sexual tension...

217
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,477
Oh, my God. You have no idea
what you sound like, do you?

218
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,758
JD, JD, check it.

219
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,795
Rat tail!

220
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,831
You don't wanna play?

221
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,672
Too slow. What now, Mr Smart Guy?

222
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,349
That is so not funny.

223
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,554
Wet butt!

224
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,073
- It gets better.
- Is it starting to burn?

225
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,072
I would think so.
Hey, don't touch your eyes.

226
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,837
<i>OK, right back on the horse.</i>

227
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,831
- Thank you all for agreeing to talk.
- You paged us here.

228
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,910
I think there are simple solutions.

229
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,388
- Dr Cox, you're angry with me.
- No, I'm not.

230
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,515
- You're in love with Carla.
- He's not.

231
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,396
- I am.
- You're starting again.

232
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,947
You're mad Turk
didn't trust you enough to say.

233
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,154
See? Trust, woman.

234
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:47,309
- Turk is sorry.
- Not any more.

235
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,674
- You thought he was a threat!
- I'm a threat.

236
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,557
- You're not in love, you idealise me.
- Stay focused.

237
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,755
You're mad cos
I'm scared of losing you?

238
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,832
- Yes, because we're stronger than that.
- Apparently not.

239
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,513
Be glad I never took you for granted,
silly woman.

240
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,193
- Refrain from name-calling.
- Oprah's right.

241
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,237
- Lay off!
- You're still in love with your ex.

242
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,356
That's it!
I've killed for much less than that.

243
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:15,308
And I'll do it again unless you all
shut up now. And I mean now!

244
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,674
Glad we did this?

245
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,514
I'm going out for Mexican food tonight.
I'll see you in bed, my friend.

246
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,270
Oh, my God! Rounds.

247
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:35,034
<i>Rounds started five minutes ago</i>
<i>and I totally forgot about Mr Zerbo.</i>

248
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,677
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

249
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,157
Are you planning on
making this worth my while?

250
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,512
Dr Dorian, step up to the mike
and tell the entire gang

251
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,590
how you ended up treating Mr Zerbo.

252
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,955
<i>Think, whizz kid, think.</i>

253
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,950
<i>The hell with it...</i>

254
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,428
Sir, I did nothing.

255
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,637
Is this because of
the same kid as before?

256
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,109
- You did nothing?
- Nothing at all.

257
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,428
- Great job, sport.
- <i>Huh?</i>

258
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,953
When a patient gets bounced
from ward to ward,

259
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,315
there's a chance a high fever
could be sustained or even caused

260
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,708
by the constant stream of antibiotics.

261
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,758
It's called drug fever.
And it's a good catch by Dr Dorian.

262
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,630
Next patient. Mush, people, mush!

263
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,478
Thank you, Doctor.

264
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,707
Oh, no problem.

265
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,791
<i>It's funny. I guess sometimes</i>
<i>when you do nothing at all,</i>

266
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,315
<i>things just have a way</i>
<i>of fixing themselves.</i>

267
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,195
That'll do it.

268
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,554
- I have other songs.
- Yeah, you do.

269
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:00,110
Do you know how I know
that this is yours, Farrah?

270
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,952
Someone found it
next to a can of Fresca

271
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,428
and a dog-eared copy
of <i>Teen People</i> magazine.

272
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,114
Anyway, long story short.
The incident gave me a bang-up idea.

273
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,315
Because you see I've got tomorrow off.

274
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,278
So I'm gonna be on my couch sipping
Scotch and paging you every 20 seconds.

275
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,147
If you don't answer every one,
I'll shove this so far down your throat,

276
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:22,834
it's gonna make you take a tinkle
every time it goes off.

277
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,557
Big fun, right?

278
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:26,994
You're gonna need this.

279
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,631
Let it come, let it...

280
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,834
<i>It's good to be home.</i>

281
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,197
<i>Sort of.</i>

282
