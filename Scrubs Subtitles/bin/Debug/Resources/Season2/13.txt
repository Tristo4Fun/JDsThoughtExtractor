1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,200
<i>Let's face it,</i>
<i>most days start like any other.</i>

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,633
<i>But some days...</i>

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,076
- Well?
- It's beautiful.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,958
But my parents will kill me
if I marry a black guy.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,475
- So you're gonna ask Carla?
- I'm doing it.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,551
OK, ready?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,835
- You sure?
- Positive.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,229
Congratulations.
When are you gonna ask her?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,710
Tonight. I'll make dinner
and put the ring in her champagne glass.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,075
Might as well put it
in her cham-lame glass.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,709
- Know-it-all. What would you do?
- First you get 50 candles, right?

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,473
Spread 'em all over the room
with some rose petals.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,996
Because the roses are beautiful
and make the room smell amazing.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,390
- Like a meadow in springtime.
- What are you talking about?

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,233
- Nothing. Guy talk.
- Yeah, bitches and hos.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,473
- Come on. Hurry up.
- I just have to get changed.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,078
Have you two met?

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,039
Todd, you're overcompensating, you're
gay, and you need to be OK with it.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,669
Oh, yeah? If I'm gay,
how come I work out so much?

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,319
<i>It's tough to be a woman</i>
<i>in a co-ed locker room.</i>

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,430
Dance, they want you to dance.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,194
Maybe I should
just change in the bathroom.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,436
Honey? Do you want some champagne?

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,239
Actually, I'm just gonna
stay with coffee.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,279
OK, coffee it is, for my baby.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,828
Oh, what the hell,
I'll have some champagne.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,357
OK.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,871
Hot!

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,871
Are you OK?

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,549
I'm absolutely fine, honey,
because I am here with you.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,631
Hello!

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,996
Mami. Why are you calling so late?

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,793
She's dead?

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,073
Yeah. I'll be right over.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,394
My aunt Marie's dead!

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,198
She's only 60.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,230
To one hell of a lady! Huh?

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,359
What?

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,995
You should be
with your mom right now.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,389
Thank you, baby.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,833
Stay out of trouble.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,794
So I have to fly out late
for the funeral tonight.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,235
I'm gonna need your help
covering my shifts.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,278
- Anything for you, honey.
- Thanks, Mama.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,635
Hey, can I borrow
a nickel so I can get a soda?

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,154
Sorry, this window's closed.

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,832
By the way, Elaine's back.

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,354
<i>Elaine's been on the transplant list</i>
<i>so long,</i>

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,795
<i>she's in and out of here</i>
<i>almost as much as I am.</i>

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,916
Hey, homeslice, we talked about this.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,912
Don't get into bed until I come in
so I can see your booty.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,592
If I finally get a damn heart,

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,557
I'll let you eat ice cream off it.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,198
You are naughty.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,953
It always feels so weird
to be sitting around,

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,918
hoping someone's family
pulls them off life support.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,197
I honestly believe in hospitals

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,556
there's like this balance, you know?

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
It's like when one person dies,

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,113
another person gets a chance to live.

61
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,351
I like to call it the Circle of Life.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,956
Oh, my God, you must stop
watching <i>The Lion King.</i>

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,998
I like that baby lion cub.
What's his name?

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,274
Simba.

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,749
Trick question! You like it too.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,831
Oh, you girls. Excuse me, Elaine.

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,230
I actually need his opinion
on something.

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,197
I'd say she's pregnant.

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,999
Terrific catch there, Newbie.
Listen to her heart.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,595
I heard mitral stenosis.
I need an extra set of ears. Let's go.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,356
- It's flattering that you'd choose me.
- Ears, Newbie, ears. Not mouth.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,550
Ted, Dr Koppleman has notified me

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,234
that he will be vacating
the office next to mine.

74
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,518
His deteriorating health has made it
impossible for him to continue with us.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
Oh, dear, should we send him a card?

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,512
Absolutely.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,909
See if you can find one that says,

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,310
"Crippling arthritis or not,
get out of my hospital by sundown

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,551
so I can knock down your wall
and make myself a giant office."

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,553
- You're a wonderful man.
- I don't mean to sound insensitive.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,474
A man's office is a reflection
of who he is, don't you think?

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,912
Yeah.

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,714
Ralphie, spit it out. Spit it out.

84
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,399
Come on.

85
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,510
Why eat medical supplies
when you've got pudding and tater tots?

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,910
- It makes no sense.
- Hey.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,197
- Get the ring back?
- Did I get the ring back?

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,510
Dude, I'm back. OK?

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,194
It's all set up.
She's going out of town for a week.

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,955
Somebody's covering for me tonight.
I'll take her to a restaurant...

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,192
You're killing me, Ralphie.

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,078
You are killing...
You did not swallow that thing!

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,317
Dr Kelso, I am through taking
my clothes off in front of men.

94
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,915
I think I can speak for all of us
when I say, "We'll live."

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,072
Every woman here hates
undressing in a co-ed locker room.

96
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,754
Except Naked Nancy,
but she's an exhibitionist.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,671
She has other problems.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,150
We have a co-ed locker room? Hot damn!

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,593
Dr Reid, if you really feel
the need to discuss it,

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,798
write it on a piece of paper
and slip it in my suggestion box.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,678
- Really?
- Yeah. Ted, show it to her.

102
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,673
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

103
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,672
So, this locker room,

104
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,070
do you have to be a doctor
to change in there, or what?

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,957
- Can I borrow a pen?
- Here. Take this one.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,837
Thanks.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,114
See?

108
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,191
We don't always have to be like...

109
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,555
We can be
"How you doing?" "Good, thanks."

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,029
This can work.
We can be there for each other.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,714
It's just a pen, Scooter, not a kidney.

112
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,516
- Thanks.
- No. You keep it.

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,511
Really?

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,990
Makes me look smarter.

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Off to scrub the crappers.

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,439
So here's the deal, Mrs Larkin. You have
a valvular defect in your heart.

117
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,034
- Oh, God!
- Relax, Steve. He's a worrier.

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
Me, too. I'm a worrier.

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,671
- The thing is...
- Ah, here it comes.

120
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,355
The thing is pregnancy puts such
an extra strain on your heart that,

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,558
had we known about this beforehand,
we would've suggested you think twice

122
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,791
about getting pregnant
before getting the valve repaired.

123
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,519
- I would've done it anyways.
- Yeah, you would've.

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,034
Got a healthy supply of pluck,
don't you?

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,076
- I can't breathe.
- You're OK.

126
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,799
- Let's do this.
- I love the pluck.

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,839
How could any woman possibly stand this?

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,275
Hey, Nancy.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,593
You've had six bran muffins, Ralphie.
How is it that you don't have to go yet?

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,194
I still have to pack.
Sure you wanna have dinner?

131
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,872
I am positive.

132
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,598
- Great.
- OK. All right.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,718
All right, Ralphie, new tack.

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,631
I want you to do what I do.

135
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,951
Imagine that there are tiny men
inside your booty,

136
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,952
trying to push the dookie out, Ralphie.

137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,917
Can you imagine that for me?

138
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,194
You told my son there were little men
inside him? He barely sleeps as it is.

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,158
- Sir, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- That was sick.

140
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,549
But still, if you could do this for me,

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,312
I would greatly appreciate it.

142
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,516
Next time your son has a bowel movement,

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,398
take the dookie,
put it in a Ziplock bag,

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,675
and just call me on my cell phone.

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,876
It's for my girlfriend.

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,755
Ralphie. Little men,
pushing it out, pushing it out.

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,229
Mrs Larkin's aggressive. She won't let
her husband finish a sen...

148
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,108
Shut up, would you, please? At least
she's ballsy. Unlike that husband.

149
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,431
The overly thoughtful, sensitive type
that drives me crazy.

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,919
What?

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,594
I think the Larkins
complement each other.

152
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,148
They're a good team.
Kinda remind me of us.

153
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,835
Roseanne, now granted, I was, as usual,
only half listening to you,

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,276
but I get the feeling you just
compared us to a married couple.

155
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,672
I know, a girl can dream
but this is never gonna happen.

156
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,909
- Get in here.
- Atrial fibrillation.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,276
Call an OBG YN for an emergency
consult and notify the NICU.

158
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,112
What the hell is going on?

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,796
<i>Sometimes it's hard</i>
<i>to find the right words.</i>

160
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,235
Once I knock down this wall right here,

161
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,915
I am going to have more room
than I know what to do with.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,753
Sir, I'm so happy for you I could crack.

163
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,592
<i>Sometimes words come easy.</i>

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,832
Dr Kelso,
I demand a female locker room.

165
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,793
I loved it, but why spend all this money
on this fancy dinner?

166
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
<i>Sometimes the words</i>
<i>don't come out at all.</i>

167
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,472
No reason.

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,554
<i>Ultimately, you grit your teeth</i>
<i>and just say it.</i>

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,234
If we don't deliver the baby,
your wife could die.

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,517
<i>You get used to the whole</i>
<i>balance-in-the-hospital thing.</i>

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,068
<i>You know, when one person lives,</i>
<i>another dies,</i>

172
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,912
<i>and how it seems to even out.</i>

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,389
But it's so soon. You said so yourself.

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,190
- What'll happen to the baby?
- We're gonna do our best.

175
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,397
<i>But it never seems fair</i>
<i>when it happens in the same family.</i>

176
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,919
You're telling me
if we don't deliver the baby now,

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,551
my wife could die, and if we do,
our child probably won't live.

178
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,428
<i>Sometimes, as a doctor, I wish my life</i>
<i>was more like my favourite TV show.</i>

179
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,431
Come on, death isn't that bad,

180
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,149
especially if you're dying
from laughter. You're on <i>Candid Camera.</i>

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,949
- No, I'm not! Honey, no!
- I'll give you "Honey, no."

182
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,871
- Come out.
- Where are the cameras?

183
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,077
We gotcha. There's a camera there.
There. And there.

184
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,629
Mr Larkin,
we need a decision from you here.

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,472
I'm not ready to do that.

186
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,957
You go. I'll cover her.

187
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,476
Dr Kelso, I am not leaving here
until I get an answer.

188
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,836
Sweetheart, there are lots of people
who think the hospital

189
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,753
would be a better place
if we made some changes.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,478
Take Ted, for instance.

191
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,872
I feel I'd be more productive
if my phone dialled out.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,794
This hospital has always
had a co-ed locker room.

193
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,351
Ah, back when I was a resident,
I remember,

194
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,159
blah-blah-blah, nostalgic story.

195
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,276
Now, get the hell out of my office.

196
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,154
Not you, Ted.

197
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,638
Ted, get the hell out of my office.

198
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,278
I'm gonna miss you so much.

199
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,715
I'm only going to Chicago for five days.

200
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,270
I'll call you when I land. See ya.

201
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,711
- Don't go.
- Have you seen Mr Larkin?

202
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,791
No.

203
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,313
Thanks for the pen.

204
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,710
- Oh, no.
- This was my favourite T-shirt.

205
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,236
And this is my favourite skin.

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,788
You know I would never
mean for that to happen.

207
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,235
- I know that.
- This is a little cosy for me.

208
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,992
I don't think you people
are getting how difficult this is.

209
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,992
Trust me, I wouldn't want
to have to make this decision.

210
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,752
I wish I could ask my wife.

211
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,354
She'd be better
at handling this than me.

212
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,874
You know, you and I are a lot alike.

213
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,555
We may seem like the kind of guy
you can just

214
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,108
throw in a headlock
and draw a moustache on,

215
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,557
but... in crunch time
we always come through.

216
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,119
It's time.

217
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,679
Come on.

218
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,874
Dr Reid, are you off for the day?

219
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,599
I just didn't have a place to change.

220
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,392
Laverne, I'm going to pretend
you're not wearing that.

221
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,517
Don't you usually wait to get home
before you do that?

222
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,434
Plus, according to county statute,
all medical facilities are required

223
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,592
to provide single-sex bathrooms
and changing rooms.

224
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,513
Put that in your suggestion box
and smoke it.

225
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,716
Dammit! Where'd she learn
all that legal mumbo-jumbo?

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,557
- What are you doing, Ted?
- I'm trying to whistle.

227
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,108
You know,
so you wouldn't think it was me.

228
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,314
Stop the cab! Whoa, hey!

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,153
Baby, open the door.
Open the damn door.

230
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,551
What are you doing?

231
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,949
- Take it.
- Sorry, ma'am, my bad.

232
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,837
What is going on?

233
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,070
I gotta ask you something before you go.

234
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,593
What?

235
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,194
You're doing great.
You're gonna be fine.

236
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,669
Nice job, Newbie, a real nice job.

237
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,433
All we gotta do now
is cross our fingers.

238
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,034
<i>Death is always hanging</i>
<i>around this hospital.</i>

239
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,193
Morning.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,956
<i>Ultimately it all boils down</i>
<i>to what your attitude is about it.</i>

241
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,678
I'm not afraid of death.

242
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,593
I mean, if I got a heart,
that would be great.

243
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,752
Still, if they told me
it was never gonna happen,

244
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,230
I think that'd be OK, too.
It's the waiting I can't take.

245
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,788
I just wanna know one way or the other,
you know?

246
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,359
I got an idea.

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,079
Why don't we switch
to a cheerier subject?

248
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,196
What do you think death is like?

249
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,716
I really hope it's like
a big Broadway musical.

250
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,236
Everyone's all dressed up,
and singing to the rafters,

251
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,949
and you go out with a real flourish.

252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,032
I think it's like a game of dodgeball.

253
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,793
There's a lot of chaos and screaming.

254
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,714
And eventually, you get your glasses
snapped in half by the big kid

255
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,438
who already has underarm hair.

256
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,909
But then you wake up
in the hot nurse's office,

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,798
and when she leans in
to put that bandage on your nose,

258
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,996
you get a sense something could happen

259
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,039
if you took a chance
and buried your face in her knockers.

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,634
Holy cow, I'm so sorry.

261
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,757
I guess, for my part,
I think death is a lot like that story,

262
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,195
quite frankly, but if there is a God,

263
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,909
it'll be a lot quicker
and half as painful.

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,037
- It's fun to annoy him.
- That's what I do.

265
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,475
So they're making that office
into the ladies' locker room?

266
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,074
- Yes, Ted.
- Bummer.

267
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,919
Hey, maybe, whoever's over here
might not stay there forever.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,835
I'm doing a research fellowship,
so I'll be anywhere from 15 to 25 years.

269
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,558
- That's a long time.
- Yeah!

270
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,829
You'll probably be dead.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,992
We've known each other for like,
a year and a half, right?

272
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,752
Turk, that's my ride.

273
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,434
Give me a second.
I've been thinking a lot lately.

274
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,959
I'm talking here!

275
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,032
I'm gonna miss my flight.
I gotta go, honey. I'm sorry.

276
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,513
Will you marry me?

277
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,238
What did you say?

278
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,118
I think I said, "Will you marry me?"

279
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,792
Turk, wow!

280
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,871
I got a ring.

281
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,792
I don't have it on me,
but... it's in a safe place.

282
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,314
I can't believe this.

283
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,078
I've imagined you saying this to me
a thousand times.

284
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,679
I just never imagined
that when you actually asked,

285
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,151
all I would say is... I need to think.

286
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,430
Cool.

287
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,715
Yeah, phew.

288
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,678
That's... what I was hoping to hear.

289
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,593
I love you. I really do.

290
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,030
Love you too.

291
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,156
I'll be back in a few days.

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,716
I'll wait.

293
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,352
Congratulations, you guys,
he's doing great.

294
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,396
<i>I guess my theory about life and death</i>

295
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,631
<i>balancing each other out in the hospital</i>
<i>doesn't hold true.</i>

296
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,711
<i>I guess sometimes you get lucky.</i>

297
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,631

- She's coding.

Yeah.
