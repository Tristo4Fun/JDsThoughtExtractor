1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,793
I still can't believe
you guys are getting married.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,917
I know. All my girlfriends
think I'm crazy.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,630
About... you...
because you're so damn cute.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,948
Good save.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,794
- Thanks for coming out tonight.
- This is the only way to celebrate,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,237
with close friends...
and Nurse Roberts.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,438
Hey, don't get all pissy now. You said,
"My treat, order whatever you want."

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,590
You didn't say, "Except the lobster."

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,238
I said no shellfish.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,029
<i>I wasn't really mad.</i>
<i>This was great, except for one thing.</i>

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,634
- Can't celebrate without beer.
- Absolutely.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,508
<i>Sure, Paul was dating Elliot,</i>
<i>but luckily I'm not the jealous type.</i>

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,751
Well, I'll go ahead
and make a little toast here.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,832
A toast that only people that
have known Turk and Carla

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,832
more than a week will understand.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,631
You guys rock. You do.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,711
<i>How's that taste, blondie?</i>

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,633
You know, I've just gotten
to know you as a couple,

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,429
but you remind me of my grandparents.
They were married for 65 years,

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,069
Every night, before Grandpa and Grandma
walked around the block,

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,756
he would look deep into her eyes
as if to say, "I'd follow you anywhere."

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,513
Anyway, the way you two
just looked at each other,

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,750
I could've sworn I was looking at them.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,116
Lame! This guy.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,872
Morning, Dr Kelso.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,750
How is it this hospital gets up in arms
if our MRI machine misses a tumour,

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,877
but every morning our coffee machine
spits out warm urine

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,520
- and nobody gives two hoots?
- We missed a tumour?

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,797
Who cares? Point is I have to go across
the street to get coffee.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,509
Piping hot coffee that puts a hop
in your step and your ass in the john.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,433
I just wish I really knew
why it hurt so much right here.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,750
Mr Simms,
it could be because it's damp out.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,992
It could also be because four days ago
I sliced your chest open with a knife.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,435
You had surgery, buddy, you'll be fine.

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,080
Dr Dorian,
I have a couple of minutes off.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,914
Would you like me to show you
that technique I told you about?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,358
See, now what you wanna do
is choke up on the club, like this.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,557
And then hit this bad boy
like a baseball.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,273
You can't teach that.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,669
No, you cannot, my friend,
no, you cannot.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,320
So what was up with Mr Simms
back there?

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,152
During his open-lung biopsy,

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,028
I accidentally nicked his intercostal
artery, now he's got a haematoma.

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,556
- Are you gonna tell him?
- What, and risk a lawsuit?

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,870
Besides, it'll heal just fine, anyway.

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,110
Hey, throw me another ball.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,668
- Do you believe in bad karma?
- No.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,790
Hot cup of lava coming through.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,194
I don't know, me, I think karma
keeps the universe in order.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,872
Karma-shmarma.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,713
If you're not getting
the length on the drive you need

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,268
a lot of the better pros
take a running start.

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,793
Righty-o!

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,071
<i>In medicine, you get used to seeing</i>
<i>a lot of horrible things.</i>

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,832
Morning, sport.

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,229
<i>My God, do not say splotchy.</i>

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,393
- Good splotchy, Dr Splotchy.
- Oh, it's barely noticeable.

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,836
- Oh, dark roast.
- Dammit.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,436
There she is.
Are you ready to be born today?

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,114
Get away from my stomach
or I'll put you in a leg lock

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,953
and snap your bird neck
with my enormous thighs.

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,077
- Enjoy your special day.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,720
Now, in honour
of this little goblin's arrival,

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,189
I have gone ahead and taken
care of everything.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,669
Dr Gerson will be waiting
to induce you.

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,832
She will also administer
the world's largest epidural.

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,673
I have awfully under-qualified residents

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,273
covering all of my patients

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,079
so that I can be with you
every step of the way

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,116
and here's the kicker.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,589
I have traded every single one
of my weekends,

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,238
I have called in every favour,

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,472
and kissed every pompous, wrinkled ass
in this fluorescent hellhole

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,471
so that I could secure for you,

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,917
the one-and-only, mack-daddy,
out-of-your-mind birthing suite

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,230
in this entire hospital.

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,197
Nice job, Alice.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,158
- Hey, Paul.
- What are you doing down here?

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,992
I just need a nurse to help me out.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,230
This nametag says
"Paul Flowers, Nurse",

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,949
not "Paul Flowers, Boyfriend".
Now, what do you need?

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,429
Mr Mahoney threw up on himself.
He needs a bath.

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,116
Hey, Deena,
my girlfriend's got a job for you.

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,078
- Right...
- Paul, I just want you to know.

85
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,310
I am having such a good time with you.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,992
Me, too.

87
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,829
Sorry I didn't call last night.
I just crashed.

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,672
No big deal.

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,389
You don't let little things bother you.
Like now, you've got pit stains

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,948
and you're like, whatever,
I'm working hard.

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,554
What can I say?
I'm an easy-going gal.

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,513
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,512
I need deodorant
and a dry top over here!

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,792
<i>Doctors love to use humour.</i>

95
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,678
Well, Mr Foster,
your blood tests are back,

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,149
and the good news is
you're not pregnant.

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,308
Cos your...

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,635
I said, "not pregnant."
Is this thing on?

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,872
And hey, what is the deal with Q-tips?

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,679
They're not Qs
and they're not tips.

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,034
But unfortunately,
the CAT scan suggests

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,633
a laceration in your spleen,

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,439
which is why I asked
for a surgical consult.

104
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,192
So how'd this happen anyway?

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,034
A golf ball hit my windshield
and I drove into a tree.

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,192
OK, here's the deal.

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,192
You are in fact supposed to be
up in the mack-daddy suite,

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,158
but the woman who's in there
is in her 40th hour of labour.

109
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,038
Did you explain to her
that it is my room?

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,908
I started to, then she screamed,
grunted, pooped on the table.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,516
God, it cracks me up that they never
tell pregnant women to expect that one.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,398
I'm going to poo in front of people?

113
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,198
No.

114
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,032
Yeah.

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,236
- We are so done talking.
- Don't tease me.

116
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,276
- Where's Dr Gerson?
- With that woman.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,078
Who the hell will take care of me?

118
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,754
- She's sending her resident.
- Hey, happy couple.

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,594
Hi, I'm Donna Berlutti,
but you can call me Dr Donna!

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,796
- Carla, you know how I'm really crazy?
- Sure, what's up?

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,916
It's so hard
to hide the crazy from Paul.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,434
I hear you, girl.
Turk and I are engaged,

123
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,590
and only last week I admitted the reason

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,274
I don't touch the seat in the bathroom
isn't germs

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,555
but because I'm afraid of toilet snakes.

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,392
And now so am I.

127
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,995
With men, you just have to hold out
until they're invested enough

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,196
they won't run away at the first thing.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,795
I know, and with Paul, I feel like
we're getting pretty close now.

130
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,916
- So, you guys have...
- Not yet.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,629
- But tonight's our fourth date.
- Four dates?

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,030
One date longer than the sluts,
one date shorter than prudes.

133
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,111
I am Four-Date Reid.

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,668
Yeah, but what about
that surgeon the other...?

135
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,352
I'm Four-Date Reid!

136
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,512
Hey, cutie.
Hey! You ready for our third date?

137
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,275
Fourth. You forgot the time we ran
into each other at the coffee machine.

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,588
You shut up.

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,272
Hi.

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,519
Why am I playing golf?
This is all Tiger Woods' fault.

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,230
This guy'll sue the hospital, we'll get
fired, we'll have to become male whores.

142
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,471
Successful whores.
A nicer apartment and some bling-bling,

143
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,189
- but male whores nonetheless.
- Relax. Nobody knows about this but us.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,430
- We'll be fine.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys.

145
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,035
Check out the personalised golf club
cosy I found on the roof.

146
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,553
Hi, Davy.

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,949
You and your stupid Christmas present.

148
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,316
One of the balls you hit
went through the windshield of my van.

149
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
No big deal.
I just expect you to replace it.

150
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,236
Your windshield's
been broken for a year.

151
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,675
Yeah, I know. Still...

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,910
Oh, no!

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,278
Looks like we're in a pickle.
Pick, pick, pickle.

154
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,352
Here's the keys.
Have it back by tomorrow.

155
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,556
- Who are you?
- Dr Turk.

156
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,232
I don't care.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,831
I'm not gonna lie to you there, Bob.

158
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,912
I have not been
having the greatest day.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,790
I just drew in this eyebrow five
minutes ago, so cry me a river.

160
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,917
Anyway, Jordan and I got stuck
in this crappy room

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,949
and I was wondering if... whew!

162
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,229
If you want a favour, don't beat
around the bush, just curtsey.

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,276
I beg your pardon, there, <i>Backdraft?</i>

164
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,715
You heard what I said. Well?

165
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,153
Always remember
how I made you do that.

166
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,715
Hey, fellas!
Always nice to have visitors.

167
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,030
So, what's the dealio?

168
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,395
Ted, how bad would it really be

169
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,711
if two doctors were hitting
golf balls off the roof

170
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,429
and they caused a car accident
and the driver needed surgery?

171
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,469
Ted?

172
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,677
Hey, fellas.
Always nice to have visitors.

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,672
- So what's the dealio?
- No dealio, Ted.

174
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,753
We just stopped by to say hi.
Hi.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,513
See you later, buddy.

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,272
- Later.
- Hmm!

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,158
- <i>We knew what we had to do.</i>
- Let's come clean.

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,711
Let's not tell anyone ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever.

179
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,518
- Ever?
- Ever.

180
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,672
<i>I guess it's hard to predict</i>
<i>how a person will react.</i>

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,990
So, you wanna come in?

182
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,230
Nah, it's OK.
I'll see you tomorrow.

183
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,712
Well, Jordan, why don't we just
think of today as a test run?

184
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,315
<i>Other times, people react</i>
<i>exactly how you think they will.</i>

185
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,755
The only way I could've felt
more taken care of

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,230
is if I were at a four-star resort,
or a spa, or a Third World country

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,471
where you boil your own sewage
if you want something to drink.

188
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,393
Oh, and by the way,
giant, giant feather in your cap

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,199
for how much power you wield here
after 15 years!

190
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,633
Come on, come on, Jordan.

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,792
I am so sorry everything fell apart
today, honest to God I am.

192
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,916
I guarantee when you get here tomorrow,

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,754
Dr Gerson will, in fact,
be in the super-deluxe birthing suite.

194
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,469
So that you can go ahead
and have that storybook, drug-addled,

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,439
Pitocin-induced pregnancy you've
dreamed of since you were a small girl.

196
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,193
But in the meantime,
you gotta cut me a little slack.

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,874
I mean, come on,
it's not like I see the real father

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,431
- running around here busting his hump.
- Oh, that's nice. I'm going home.

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,351
- No, no, you're not.
- Bye-bye.

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,000
Jordan, your water just broke.

201
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,550
This kid's annoying me already.

202
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,115
I think having babies is so much fun.

203
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,277
- I will choke her.
- Dr Berlutti, no more talking.

204
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,794
Oh, you know,
I really prefer Dr Donna.

205
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,589
No means no, Pep Squad,
now beat it. And Jordan...

206
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,430
I am not gonna leave your side
until that baby is delivered.

207
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,909
- Get the hell out of here.
- What?

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,676
I'm serious. Why don't you do us
both a favour and get out?

209
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,876
Fine.

210
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,477
It's important to stay positive.

211
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Get me an epidural
before I rip your teeth out!

212
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,633
Okey-dokey.

213
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,392
- Hey, Girl's Name.
- What?

214
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,755
Give me a break.
I got a lot on my mind, Ellen.

215
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,035
Look at that, I bounced back.

216
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,998
Anyway, the cave bat
just kicked me out of its lair.

217
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,117
Seeing as I no longer have my
all-access pass to Crazy Town,

218
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,397
I need you to occasionally go in
and poke her with a broomstick,

219
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,038
just to see how she's doing.

220
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,910
- Dr Cox.
- Please, just check on her, OK?

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,632
What if she has the baby
while I'm in there?

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,958
- Here it comes!
- What the hell is that?

223
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,393
Get it off! Get it off!
Somebody get it off!

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,352
<i>I'll check on her later.</i>

225
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,599
- Elliot, wait up. Elliot.
- Hey.

226
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,830
I wanted to explain about last night.

227
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,274
We had a great time and I know
you wanted me to come in to...

228
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,069
Oh, no, no, no, I invited you
in to see my fish tank.

229
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,993
Is that what you ladies
are calling it nowadays?

230
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,198
- Careful, Todd.
- Sorry, Nurse Flowers, sir.

231
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,192
Elliot, I think you're an amazing girl,
I really do.

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,829
But something just didn't feel right
about last night.

233
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,480
I've rushed things with people
in the past,

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,357
and I don't wanna do that with you.

235
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,829
<i>In the past?</i>
<i>Does he have an ex-girlfriend?</i>

236
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,354
<i>Is that her? Slut!</i>

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,078
I feel the same way.

238
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,918
- Hey!
- Oh, I am on to you.

239
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,198
I'm going this way.

240
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,034
So now, why'd you finally agree
to marry Gandhi?

241
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,510
Well, he's amazing in bed
and he has an awesome CD collection.

242
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,229
Seriously. What got you to the point
where you weren't scared anymore?

243
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,356
Please, I'm still terrified.

244
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
Good luck finding a pen cap
at the nurses' station.

245
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,878
- Know why?
- Why?

246
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,952
- Ate 'em all.
- Sounds like good roughage.

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,235
What do you do
when you get scared?

248
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,438
Run away, get a divorce, drink alone.
You know, the classics.

249
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,957
The thing is that this time I am
killing myself for this woman

250
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,190
and I'm still getting my ass
handed to me.

251
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,068
There is no Shangri-La, you know.
Every relationship is messed up.

252
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,312
What makes it perfect is if you still
wanna be there when things really suck.

253
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,837
- You know, I'm not so sure.
- It'll come to you.

254
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,589
Right, gentlemen, either of you
in the market for a van? $500.

255
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,240
- The windshield cost that much.
- Oh, 800.

256
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,878
- No, thanks.
- Come on.

257
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,474
There's still half a deer in the back.

258
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,558
I think that's a deer.

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,790
<i>After being blackmailed,</i>
<i>I decided to check in on Jordan.</i>

260
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,509
You tell me, Donna.
Do I look like I need more drugs?

261
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,318
Ow, my face!

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,556
<i>Then again, I have other problems.</i>

263
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,677
<i>I know some windshield hush money</i>
<i>won't keep the karma gods</i>

264
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,398
<i>from coming after Turk and me.</i>

265
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,198
Q-tip, Dr Murphy called.

266
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,430
They need you
to cover his call tonight.

267
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,078
Dude, Dr Wen's
doing a stomach stapling

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,789
and he wants you to be there
to hold back the guy's fat flap.

269
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,788
Apparently, my face
is scaring my patients,

270
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,758
so you're gonna take them off
my hands for about a week.

271
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,355
Turk, the Dairy Queen burned down.

272
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,954
- No.
- Now do you see?

273
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,157
I can't take it.
I cannot hide the crazy a minute longer.

274
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,836
The worst part is, Paul is this perfect
guy who wants to take things slow.

275
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,229
I'm this mountain of cuckoo
about to erupt

276
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,517
and spew molten crazy over him
and he's gonna die like this.

277
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,989
Calm down. Do what I used to do.

278
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,868
Find people who don't even know Paul,
and just let it out in little bursts.

279
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,235
Good afternoon, ladies.

280
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,076
When I was a kid,
I got a sunburn like that.

281
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,072
I just peeled all the skin off,
put it in a pile and ate it.

282
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,037
Good Lord.

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,112
<i>For us, it was time</i>
<i>to face the karmic music.</i>

284
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,668
- We hit your car with that golf ball.
- Well, technically, it was Dr Turk.

285
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,593
You liar. OK, it was you!

286
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,353
You know what, it really doesn't matter.

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,079
Why were you guys
hitting golf balls way downtown?

288
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,675
- Downtown?
- I told you it wasn't us.

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,833
This is almost exactly like
the kind of picnics

290
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,512
I had with my mother.

291
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,591
You're so cute.

292
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,711
And now it's exactly like 'em.
You got something in your tooth.

293
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,075
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>I have something on my teeth.</i>

294
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,310
<i>Get it off, get it off.</i>

295
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,671
- Did I get it?
- No, but don't worry about it.

296
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,877
So, anyway, I was thinking... Elliot?

297
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,996
Elliot, is everything all right?

298
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,476
Everything's great, yeah!

299
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,357
Come here.

300
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,792
What?

301
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,509
It's just, well, this is what
bothered me the other night.

302
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,149
I know there's something wrong
but you won't talk about it.

303
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,516
I guess sometimes it feels like
you're holding back.

304
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,713
Of course I'm holding back!
I'm insane, you idiot.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,950
Remember when you told me
I had pit stains?

306
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,237
I've cried every 15 minutes
on the half-hour since you told me.

307
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,959
I am racked with self-doubt,
I'm claustrophobic,

308
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,316
germophobic, phobia-phobic.
I talk to myself, I talk to my cat,

309
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,789
I talk to three separate shrinks
about the fact

310
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,269
that my cats respond to me
in my mother's voice,

311
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,397
and yesterday, when that stupid,
pretty surgical nurse

312
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,790
handed you latex gloves,
I almost killed a guy I was stitching up

313
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,555
because I couldn't stop thinking about
you having sex on a box of steaks.

314
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,315
Why a box of steaks? My dad
had an affair with a female butcher.

315
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,996
And, as I mentioned before, I am insane.
There, I opened up. Are you happy?

316
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,877
No.

317
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,712
I'm incredibly turned on.

318
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,359
I've gotta, uh,
get this right outta my teeth.

319
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,476
Excuse me.

320
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,915
- [crash]
- Ow! I'm OK.

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,675
<i>I still believe in karma, and if I</i>
<i>wasn't being punished for Mr Golf Ball,</i>

322
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,354
<i>I think I knew where</i>
<i>my bad karma was coming from.</i>

323
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,352
I don't know that many straight guys
that wear cologne.

324
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,749
- I'm down to one spritz.
- Hmm?

325
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,229
Look, Dr Cox asked me
to check in on you.

326
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,470
I'm sorry
I haven't been here until now.

327
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,030
- He asked you to check on me?
- Yep.

328
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,478
- So, how're you doing?
- Well, I've ruined everything.

329
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,711
All he tried to do was take care
of me and show me he loved me.

330
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,315
But, no, I had to drive him away
because I don't like being vulnerable

331
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,517
even when I'm normal,
let alone with my ankles in stirrups

332
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,511
and my cootchie on display.

333
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,591
So, now he's gone away for good

334
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,148
and I would like to get
this stupid thing out of me

335
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,196
so I can go home and kill myself.

336
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,998
Well, you sound good.

337
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,469
I was going to tell him
the truth eventually.

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,915
I just wanted to see
if he was going to be with me

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,514
because he wanted to,
not because he had to.

340
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,558
- Do you know what I mean?
- What are you talking about?

341
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
It's his baby, stupid.
Don't tell anyone.

342
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,636
All right, Kappa Gamma says
it's time to get this thing underway,

343
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,508
so I don't care if you want me here
or not, I'm staying.

344
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,319
- Whatever, all right.
- Good.

345
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,551
What were you talking about?

346
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,757
Apartheid.

347
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,070
- It's wrong.
- Oh...

348
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,675
<i>Call me New Agey,</i>
<i>but I think karma's a powerful force.</i>

349
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,517
I honestly don't know what put

350
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,239
the idea of golfing on the roof
in my head.

351
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,311
Dude, it is so nice out here.

352
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,198
Do you mind if I take it down
to the banana hammock?

353
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,713
<i>Because I honestly believe</i>

354
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,598
<i>if you've got some bad karma</i>
<i>coming your way, well...</i>

355
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,908
Hi, Dr Kelso.

356
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,389
<i>You can't hide from it.</i>

357
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,269
<i>Karma's really just</i>
<i>doing the right thing.</i>

358
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,238
So, anyway, Mr Simms,

359
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,357
I wanted to explain to you
why your chest was hurting.

360
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,635
During surgery, I...

361
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,950
<i>Or about being who you really are.</i>

362
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,756
<i>Either way, it's a lot to think about.</i>

363
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,389
Oh, my God, would you look
at the mug on Jordan's baby?

364
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,835
Must have one butt-ugly father.

365
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,672
Yeah.

366
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,796
<i>Damn you, karma.</i>

367
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
