1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,592
<i>When you're dating a woman</i>

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,274
<i>whose husband just died</i>
<i>after two years in a coma,</i>

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,318
<i>you can't help but have doubts</i>
<i>about the relationship.</i>

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,437
<i>I guess all you can do is</i>
<i>be a man and face those doubts.</i>

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,556
What are you thinking about?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,312
Eggs.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,073
One minute they're bad for you,
now everybody's,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,674
"You tried eggs? They're great."
It's crazy.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,911
- Eggs.
- You know what? Forget I asked.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,797
What?

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,110
I really wanted tonight
to be romantic.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,792
Sweetie, it is.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,314
No, exactly how much feeling

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,630
am I supposed to lose
in my extremities?

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,632
Just enough so it still hurts.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,678
<i>Still, things are going pretty well</i>
<i>with me and Jamie.</i>

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,356
Looks like rope burn to me.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,113
Oh, no, this is a rash
from my new watch.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,839
They didn't tell me
the band was made of...

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,273
Cat.

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
Elliot, check out these wedding dresses.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,191
I'm so proud of you right now.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,350
This is exactly like the dress I bought.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,272
I didn't buy a wedding dress. I'm not
dating anybody, so that would be crazy,

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,749
whether it was half off or not.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,712
There is not one good thing
about a wedding I can't afford.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,917
Turk, I know it's silly,
and I know it's only for one day,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,911
but ever since I was a little girl

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,753
all I wanted to do
was have a big, beautiful wedding.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,479
What's the name of that designer
you love so much?

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,551
She made that gown? Vera?

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,949
Wang.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,792
You're the only two doctors

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,269
immature enough
to laugh at the name Vera Wang.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,749
- Hello.
- Go ahead.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,274
What? Vera Wang
makes very beautiful gowns.

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,158
Plus, her last name
is a very funny word for penis.

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,276
Who's with me? Air-five.

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,311
- Shorts, huh?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,119
I don't get to wear shorts
cos I'm a lowly janitor?

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,237
- I didn't say lowly.
- So now I'm a janitor?

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,673
Yes.

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,399
- Have you been drinking?
- I'm not drunk.

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,278
I love your shorts.
I wish I had a pair just like them.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,268
OK, the angioplasty went well.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,715
But here's the thing.
It is on you, partner.

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,679
Watch what you eat so that
we can kick this thing in the ass.

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,752
- It's on you, partner.
- Oh, gosh, Shannon.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,630
Thank you so much for clarifying
my point by repeating it word for word.

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,358
In a reciprocal gesture,

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,637
am I included in the planning
of your coming-out party?

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,154
- Is that a gay joke?
- No, it's a cotillion joke.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,994
My God, Newbie, it's been
two furiously frustrating years.

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,799
How is it possible
that you still don't get me?

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,758
I would never compare you
to the gays. I like the gays.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,308
I like their music.
I like their sense of style.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,550
I like what they've done with Halloween.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,791
But our thing
is that you're a little girl.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,030
That's who you are.
But that's not fair...

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,874
<i>Man, once Dr Cox gets on a roll,</i>
<i>nothing can derail him.</i>

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,916
My mom died.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,514
<i>Except that.</i>

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,430
Thank you for coming.
I know you're busy.

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,195
<i>It's tough working in a hospital.</i>
<i>No matter what is going on in your life,</i>

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,078
<i>you have to dive right back</i>
<i>into the middle of things.</i>

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,117
So anyway, you said you like mine.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,236
I had the wife
whip up a pair for you.

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,675
- You like 'em?
- Do I like 'em?

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,512
The other day I was asking myself,

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,158
how can I display my package

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,515
in a way that's alluring
and professional?

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,352
Well, there's your answer.

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,870
To be young and in shorts.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,350
- Are you ready for bed?
- Oh, I'm ready.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,476
<i>A lot can change in a week.</i>

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,350
Scoot. Can you hand
my mouth guard to me?

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,834
Thanks.

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,439
JD, if things have fizzled,
I could scout her out for you.

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,158
Things haven't fizzled.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,596
Last night, we made ice cubes
out of orange juice. Step off.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,319
OK, gang, before we begin,

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,436
Dr Kelso wants me to remind you

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,351
of the legal ramifications

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,113
of all your teensy snafus.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,077
Teensy snafus?

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,755
Good God, Ted.
It's not a Dr Seuss story.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,878
Now, listen up, nametags.

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,838
Over 50 per cent of our lawsuits
can be traced back

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,195
to poor patient-doctor communication.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,193
To that end, if any of you still feel
the need to flap your babble holes,

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,748
you will be joining me
in my new daily seminar

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,592
on doctor-patient relations.

93
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,673
My first invitee will be Dr Murphy,
whom I overheard telling someone,

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,752
"Stop bleeding,
oh, God, please stop bleeding."

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,515
- It was a gusher.
- Next catastrophe.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,352
Idiots.

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,591
I hate him so much.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,399
Save it for our weekend bike ride.

99
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,917
Would you like to try
one of my world-famous devilled eggs?

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,468
No, thank you,
I've already had diarrhoea.

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,711
Carla,
I just wanted to see how you're...

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,039
It's always tough when you
have to bury your old mom, isn't it?

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,397
- How was your mother's funeral?
- Don't know, skipped it.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,074
My aunt told my father
it was very moving.

105
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,875
Gosh.

106
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,791
<i>Wow, the past and the present.</i>

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,668
<i>Whenever I see two women</i>
<i>I've been intimate with</i>

108
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,877
<i>talking to each other,</i>
<i>I always have the same fantasy.</i>

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,552
C'mon, ladies.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,359
It's right hand, left hand,
shoulder pop, jump.

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,434
- What you talking about?
- Not the Rerun Dance.

112
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,112
<i>I tell her way too much.</i>

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,156
You left some stuff at my apartment.

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,595
- Thanks.
- See ya.

115
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,074
Wanna know why things with Jamie
are so lamey?

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,913
- We're doing fine.
- She's clearing you out.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,390
Wrong. She came by because
she knows today at work I need my

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,991
squash goggles.

119
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,071
I have to saw something later.

120
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,116
She's a drama queen, JD.

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,112
When her husband was in a coma,
it was taboo and exciting,

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,634
but now that it's OK
for you to be together,

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,711
the relationship's got no snap.

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,234
It's got no crackle.

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,437
JD, it's got no pop.

126
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,795
I know, because I'm a drama queen, too.

127
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,075
Well, Jamie's not like you, OK?

128
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,874
No pop!

129
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,958
Nine pounds in a week?
Let me ask you a quick question.

130
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,190
Are you trying
to make my head explode?

131
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,953
Because you have no idea
just how frustrating it is

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,873
working your ass off trying to inflate

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,918
a tiny little balloon
inside someone's clogged artery

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,912
and all that person has to do, really,
is, I don't know,

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,629
go for a walk in the morning
or choke down a fresh green salad

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,950
and you come back here
looking like that.

137
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,828
I know. Here I am,
supposed to be Dr Give-A-Crap.

138
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,993
You wanna know the God's honest truth?
This is a fact. You are what you eat.

139
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,629
You clearly went out
and devoured a big fat guy, didn't ya?

140
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,552
See, Dr Cox,
this is the sort of hostile behaviour

141
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,074
that can cause us legal difficulty.

142
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,913
Ted, I just might rip that tie
off your neck

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,877
and jam it down your oesophagus.

144
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,270
I think you proved at Nurse Roberts'
above-ground pool party

145
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,875
- that doesn't solve anything.
- Dammit, you can't just go around

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,554
browbeating nut jobs
and bullying fatties.

147
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,428
I'm not a resident, so I'm not
going to your lame-ass seminar

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,431
so in essence there, Big Bob,

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,911
there's really nothing
you can do to me at all, is there?

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,390
Hello, class.
My name is Dr Perry Cox.

151
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,074
I'm going to be your teacher.

152
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,037
No.

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,189
You OK?

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,919
Great.
What are you doing home so early?

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,116
I just came to check on you.

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,350
You looking at pictures?

157
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,429
Yeah.

158
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,472
I know she was old.

159
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,996
Still, she was my best friend.

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,277
I mean, what are you supposed to do
without your mom?

161
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,594
You can let your man
fill a little bit of the hole she left.

162
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,231
She would like that.

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,594
- Baby, she hated me.
- Yeah, she did.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,038
- Holy...
- Calm down.

165
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,793
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Why are we whispering?

166
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,440
To see if you would whisper
because I whispered.

167
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,114
- I think I would.
- Anyway, what's the deal?

168
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
We're shorts buddies today.
You saw the schedule.

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,388
Monday, Tuesday, shorts,
Wednesday, wash 'em,

170
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,756
Thursday, Friday. Weekend, optional.
I'll be wearing shorts.

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,718
You know, I was gonna wear them,
but someone stole 'em.

172
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,633
- What? Let me see.
- Yes.

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,280
<i>As a doctor, you get good</i>
<i>at thinking on your feet.</i>

174
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,430
<i>I protected the janitor's feelings.</i>

175
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,829
<i>Plus, he totally bought it.</i>

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,477
This burger's really meaty.

177
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,950
I'm serious. You can taste all the meat.

178
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,759
You know, I'm actually
gonna go put my sweats on.

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,319
You're wearing sweats.

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,152
You know, I gotta get up early,

181
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,708
so maybe you should crash
at your place tonight.

182
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,236
<i>She probably does have to</i>
<i>get up early. So just be cool.</i>

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,275
I'm sorry.
It was a total accident, I just...

184
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,797
Don't lie to me. I asked you to go,
so you punched through my coffee table.

185
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,030
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>she does want drama.</i>

186
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,112
Sometimes you make me so crazy.

187
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,717
Come here, I'll take care of you.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,992
<i>This is totally normal. In relationships</i>
<i>you have to roll with the punches.</i>

189
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,351
<i>Even the ones you don't see coming.</i>

190
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,797
If there were anything I could do
to make you feel better, I'd do it.

191
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,712
Let's get married now.

192
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,638
She wants to get married now?

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,315
- She says spontaneity is romantic.
- Wow, that is romantic.

194
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,994
- So how pregnant is she?
- She's not pregnant.

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,913
I was getting really psyched
for this whole wedding.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,356
The dancing, the band.
You'd hook up with Carla's sister.

197
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,351
- Which one?
- The drunkest one.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,318
There's no bachelor party,
and you being the best man,

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,073
I know you would've hooked it up.

200
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,549
All right, guys, let's make it happen.

201
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,273
Dude.

202
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,836
It would've been awesome.

203
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,310
I'm having a hard time
getting excited about all of this.

204
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,075
You work here so I guess we could do
the whole ceremony for 40 bucks.

205
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,673
Praise Jesus!

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,513
<i>As for my relationship,</i>
<i>I was doing anything I could</i>

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,431
<i>to keep the drama alive.</i>

208
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,399
Jamie and I are gonna be together,
and I don't care what you think, Mom.

209
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,429
Because I don't want salad, that's why.

210
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,035
Jamie and I will be together.
I don't care what you think, Dad.

211
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,595
I'm warning you,
stop eyeballing my woman.

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,831
Actually, JD, I think it was that guy.

213
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,151
No, it was definitely that guy.

214
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,595
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I was running out of ideas.</i>

215
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,672
- How's the drama queen doing?
- I don't know, how are you?

216
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,479
- Why can't you admit I'm right?
- Because you're not right.

217
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,710
No pop.

218
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,118
What was that all about?

219
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,236
<i>I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.</i>

220
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,038
Well, we used to be a couple.

221
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,554
Now you're in the picture,
who wants me back?

222
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,313
- <i>Fine, I'd stoop.</i>
- She better watch it.

223
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,756
Lester, honey, I don't want you
using the stove on your own.

224
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,229
Nurse, I asked for an extra pillow
an hour ago.

225
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,472
I'm talking to my husband.
Why don't you get your own pillow?

226
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,993
What?

227
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,435
And they stuck you in here for that?

228
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,751
I apologised to the old man.
Anybody can have a bad day.

229
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,910
And what about you there, Beavis?

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,672
Oh, uh...

231
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,594
You know, I'm getting a little tired
of the sexual innuendo.

232
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,190
In your endo.

233
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,157
That's great stuff.

234
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,758
Ted, why don't you be a sport
and get us started?

235
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,670
- People, we're here today...
- Snore.

236
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,036
New idea. All clam up for an hour
so I can get some shuteye.

237
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,317
- Oh, and nervous guy?
- Yes, Dr Cox?

238
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,029
If I were you, I'd swallow that
entire mouthful of baby carrots.

239
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,190
If I hear you make
one more damn crunch,

240
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,195
I'll use the rest of the carrots in that
bag to make you completely airtight.

241
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,349
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hey, slut.

242
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,870
I can totally explain
why Jamie said that.

243
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,509
You know Turk says, "Hey, player,"
when he means, "Hey, buddy."

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,912
Jamie's from Cincinnati
and in Cincinnati they say "Hey, slut."

245
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,314
Neat.

246
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,834
Are you sure
you're happy we're doing this?

247
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,990
Are you kidding?
It's my ideal wedding.

248
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,514
It's cheap, there's no hassle,

249
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,875
plus you said
you'd call my mom and explain.

250
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,632
No, I didn't.

251
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,359
- What's in it for me?
- This.

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,430
My God!

253
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,751
Give me the phone.
I'll call her right now.

254
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,436
- You are such a mama's boy.
- Please. Dial Mommy.

255
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,795
Dammit, Perry, you're there to teach.

256
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,553
If I wanted somebody
to lay around and do nothing,

257
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,189
I would've wheeled in a corpse,
or my housekeeper, Rosalba.

258
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,909
Captain Clip-On.
Did you go ahead and tattle on me?

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,434
Oh, please, with the shocked look.

260
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,988
Newsflash, I'm sterile.

261
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,992
I mean, gutless.

262
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,469
My guys swim in circles.

263
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,279
I think it's the bike riding.

264
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,830
- Hey, Elliot.
- Hey, slut!

265
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,036
- Excuse me?
- Carla!

266
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,829
Could you give us a second?
I got to talk to her privately.

267
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,797
Thank you.

268
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,474
I just wanted to say
you were right about Jamie.

269
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,710
What does Jamie
think you're doing here?

270
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,837
Saying not to show up at
my apartment drunk, naked, crying.

271
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,151
You know what's weird?
I really like this girl,

272
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,913
but I'm not sure I carry it on
without all the drama.

273
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,959
You have to gamble that once the drama's
gone, there'll be something there.

274
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,669
If not, it's her loss.
Still, if it helps...

275
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,871
Thanks.

276
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,589
OK, here we go.

277
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,911
When hospital employees
fail to communicate with patients,

278
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,878
there are ethical
and legal ramifications that lead

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,793
to financial hardship
and grievances against...

280
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,630
...doctors.

281
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,030
This is useless. I thought we
were going to learn something.

282
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,588
Barbie? Why did they toss you in here?

283
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,879
They didn't. I'm auditing.

284
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,598
Fine.

285
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,432
If you wanna know the real skinny.

286
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,556
If you wanna be good doctors and nurses,

287
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,712
you'd damn sure better get ready
to get in trouble a lot,

288
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,758
because patients are stupid
and they are really scared.

289
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,355
Some of them need you
to hold their hands, and you should.

290
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,750
Others need you to kick their asses,
and you should do that too.

291
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,229
It comes down to whether
you have the guts to say

292
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,632
what you know in your heart of hearts
you really should say...

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,872
So, Ted, how's Professor Cox doing?

294
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,791
Excellent, sir.

295
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,991
You know what else?

296
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,230
- I quit.
- No, you don't.

297
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,878
Well, I'm leaving early.

298
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,633
No, you're coming to my office
and doing busy work.

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,756
Fine, but I'm getting a soda first.

300
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,114
Whatever.

301
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,957
- Doctor...
- Janitor.

302
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,508
- What's that smell?
- I don't know.

303
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,592
Although it smells a little bit like
the truth.

304
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,797
My poor wife slaved over these.

305
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,838
She just cut off a pair of scrubs
and hemmed the bottom.

306
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,388
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

307
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,153
The Lord didn't bless my wife
with all ten fingers.

308
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,152
She's only got pointer and thumb-pinky.

309
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,833
Look, I'm sorry, OK,
for so many things.

310
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,912
But I'm a doctor.
I can't really wear shorts to work.

311
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,150
- You can't wear shorts to work?
- Nope.

312
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,192
- You can't wear shorts to work?
- Not allowed.

313
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,636
Thanks.
What's up with the man-thong?

314
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,632
Oh, nothing,
I'm just trying to mend some fences.

315
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,914
Do you think Elliot's somewhere
right now, crying her eyes out?

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,275
Oh, without a doubt.

317
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,430
But not about me.

318
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,391
I kinda made all that stuff up.

319
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,153
It just seems like
you and I only really click

320
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,231
when something crazy's going on.

321
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,909
I guess I don't really wanna be
in a relationship like that.

322
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,117
- Is that an ultimatum?
- No, Jamie.

323
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,749
No, it's not an ultimatum.
It's just something to think about.

324
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,035
Oh, shoot, I gotta go.

325
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,355
- You guys are having problems?
- Yeah.

326
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Hey, sorry I'm late.

327
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,794
Well, it's just not a wedding without
a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader, is it?

328
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,997
- Are you ready, sweetie?
- Since the day I met you.

329
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,470
<i>Sometimes it takes a priest to keep you</i>
<i>from making a big mistake.</i>

330
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,950
Christopher, before we begin,
remind me of the bride's name.

331
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,871
Carla.

332
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,554
I know it's silly and it's only for
one day, but since I was a little girl,

333
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,313
all I wanted to do
was have a big, beautiful wedding.

334
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,915
- Baby, you don't wanna do this.
- What?

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,878
Since your mother passed,
you've been feeling lonely

336
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,791
and like you don't have any family.

337
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,314
I'm your family now,
whether we do it like this

338
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,198
or we wait and do it
like you've always wanted to.

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,075
Holy cow, talk about
your gigantic time wasters.

340
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,878
Tell me about it.

341
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,269
Lighten up, slut!

342
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,430
What now?

343
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,149
<i>I think relationships can be defined</i>
<i>by big moments that don't happen.</i>

344
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,270
<i>Or by the little ones that do.</i>

345
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,191
That's the stuff.

346
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,591
<i>But once you get past the drama</i>
<i>it's actually pretty simple.</i>

347
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,073
<i>All we have to do is whatever it takes</i>
<i>to make her happy.</i>

348
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,993
4,606?

349
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
