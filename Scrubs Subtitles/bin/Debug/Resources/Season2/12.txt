1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,992
Where the hell is Carla?
We're gonna miss the previews.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,878
- Hey, you're black, right?
- Here we go.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,316
I hate that stereotype that
black people yell at movie screens.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,233
Like you see some horror flick
and you'd be yelling,

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,312
"Don't go in there, girl!
He behind the door!" You know?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,709
It's like... It's offensive.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,872
You wish you were allowed
to yell at the screen, don't ya?

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,918
Why does she go in there?
I mean, he's behind the door!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,719
<i>It's weird to run into</i>
<i>someone from the hospital</i>

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,279
<i>out in the real world.</i>

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,635
- Hey, Dr Kelso.
- How ya doing, sir?

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,551
I'm just Jim Dandy.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,234
Now, unless your pants
are made out of Turtle Wax,

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,959
I suggest you boys
get your asses off of Bessie.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,031
Oh, so you named your car, huh?

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,475
<i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>life is a lot simpler at home.</i>

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,915
<i>Unless you live with</i>
<i>a co-worker you like</i>

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,594
<i>who decided she can't handle</i>
<i>sleeping with you</i>

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,432
<i>and she just</i>
<i>wants to be friends.</i>

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,511
Oh, right.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,353
- Morning, buddy.
- Morning, pal.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,514
I'll just go get dressed
and then we can go to work.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,388
<i>All right, just relax.</i>
<i>You can totally handle this.</i>

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,550
Chop-chop, buddy.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,471
Told you
I could fit in this spot.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,429
You were right. I'll just put this guy's
side-view mirror on his roof.

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,829
Hey, JD.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,909
Yes?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,958
I wanted to say something
before we go back in here.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,508
- Go ahead.
- I understand it's harder

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,672
for you to transition
into being just friends again.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,909
Why?

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,519
Because you're a guy.

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,909
What does that
have to do with anything?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,991
You're right.
Know what we should do?

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,833
Everything I own
is in this truck, including my bed.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,956
We should just get in there,
get naked,

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,635
and have sex one last time,
just get it out of our system.

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,278
JD, I was kidding
to prove a point.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,271
I know.

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,389
Oh, yeah.
This is how you like it.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,836
See? This is good.
I don't feel weird.

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,912
- I don't feel weird.
- I feel weird.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,753
<i>OK, just tell her the truth.</i>
<i>You're crazy about her.</i>

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,308
- Look, Elliot, I...
- Oh, damn.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,595
I missed the annual sleepover,
didn't I?

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,272
That wonderful time of year

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,920
when you two crazy kids
throw caution to the wind

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,275
and make sweet,
elbowy love to each other.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,036
Don't you be shy. You can tell
Uncle Co<i>xy</i> about the naught-ay.

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,715
Dr Cox, I lost my apartment and
so I was just needing a place to stay.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,836
So you went over
to your friend's house

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,911
and cried on his shoulder,
boo-hoo.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,912
You comforted her because
she was weak and vulnerable

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,878
and blah, blah, blah, nerdy sex.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,349
The end. Dear Lord,
Laverne, how in God's name

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,476
do you listen
to this crap all day long?

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,154
Are you kidding? If he turns out
to be her brother,

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,878
this is better than my stories.

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,552
Oh, you are so right.

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,676
Dude, what were her boobs like?

62
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,035
Todd, I'm standing right here.

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,554
I'm sorry.
What are your boobs like?

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,830
Oh, joy of joys, Mr Corman,
you've joined us yet again.

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,435
What imaginary disease is ailing
you this time, my good man?

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,397
He thinks he has the Yaba virus.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,392
Your hair got longer.
And I don't appreciate your tone.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,916
Last month you thought you had
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,514
I was at my friend Kelly
Papadopolous' wedding.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,114
I share a glass of ouzo
with this guy named Yanos.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,758
20 minutes later I'm in a cab,

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,513
I ask the guy to pull over
because I'm gonna explode

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,353
in some guy's rose garden.
Now what would you think?

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,237
Same thing I think right now.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,312
You got yourself a bad case
of the "Wish you were sicks."

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,313
Well, I read the symptoms
on the Internet, OK? I have Yaba.

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,995
Have you been in contact
with many exotic primates this year?

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,911
I have been to the zoo, yes.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,310
And while you were there,
did you jump into the cage

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,392
and play "toss the poop"
with the other monkeys?

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,074
Because if you did,
then you just might have Yaba.

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,072
But if that's the case,
it would be way, way down

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,071
on the list of your problems.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,153
- Give him a full work-up.
- OK, you know the drill.

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,198
Here are my vitals.
Here is the Mountain Dew.

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,475
Just kidding.
That's my urine sample.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,755
And you can start timing... now.

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,196
So, how you been doing?
Still seeing that surgeon?

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,508
No talking.

90
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,033
OK, vision perfect.

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,193
Hey, are you trying to make time
with my best girl, sport?

92
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,434
Now, how do you feel
after surgery on your...?

93
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,715
- Brain.
- Brain. Mrs Kaye is doing great,

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,758
but after this type of procedure
most people experience

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,957
- a diminished reaction time.
- Christopher, come here.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,313
Maybe you should worry
about your own reaction time.

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,551
Now, do you have
a ride home today, dear?

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,312
- I drove myself.
- Well,

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,915
it always warmed my heart
to see your face.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,036
I don't care what the old bat says,

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,509
I doubt she can back
out of her own driveway.

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,673
Tell her you're calling the DMV
and having her license revoked.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,910
Why don't you
tell her yourself, sir?

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,956
Cos she's my friend.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,713
Don't be insensitive, son.
It's ugly on you.

106
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,032
I can't take the sweet
old lady's driver's license.

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,951
She reminds me of my gram-gram.

108
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,600
- Get someone else to do it.
- Like who?

109
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,231
Give me it!

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,989
You want this?
You want this? Psych!

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,472
- Never mind.
- Hi, JD.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,357
- Hey, Lisa.
- Dude.

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,512
This gift-shop chick, did you ever...?

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,114
Turk! Elliot's right here.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,397
- Why would I care?
- I'm sorry.

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,472
I guess when I was passing by
JD's room the other night,

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,472
he was telling a different
Dr Reid not to stop.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,429
- "Dr Reid"? Sweet.
- You guys, this conversation

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,239
is starting to make me feel
a little uncomfortable.

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,153
And I'm sure Dr Reid
feels the same way.

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,994
No, I don't. You can...
with anyone that you want.

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,073
<i>So she wants to play chicken, huh?</i>
<i>Well, buckle up, missy.</i>

123
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,515
- Maybe I'll ask Lisa out again.
- You should.

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,113
- Maybe I will.
- Cool.

125
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,919
- Good. That's what I'll do.
- Let me know how it goes.

126
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,234
I'm taking my own car in case
you turn into a freak again.

127
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,231
It's a date!

128
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,152
The guy is here like a thousand
times a year taking up a bed,

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,470
and every second with him
is time away

130
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,437
from somebody I could help.

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,476
What do you want me
to do about it?

132
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,754
Follow my lead.

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,111
Alas, Mr Corman, shockingly,
all your labs have come back

134
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,033
and they're negative
for everything.

135
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,476
- Oh, come on.
- OK, I'll tell you what.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,757
You have suggested that
you're feeling rather tired lately,

137
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,195
- haven't you?
- I'm listening.

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,352
- And that you bruise easily.
- Like an old banana.

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,476
I think you're fine,
but if you'd like,

140
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,949
we can go ahead and check out
your bone marrow.

141
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,395
That would mean
sticking an enormous needle

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,152
all the way through your hip,

143
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,038
and it's very, very, very
excruciatingly painful.

144
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,156
- Right, Carla?
- Yes.

145
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,879
Thank you, Carla.
So what's it gonna be there?

146
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,236
Head home and get some rest,
or an afternoon of senseless,

147
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,995
mind-numbing...agony?

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,188
Ah, what the hell,
I'll take the giant hip needle.

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,271
<i>There's no one around.</i>
<i>Time to tell her how you really feel.</i>

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,909
- You know, Elliot...
- What's up, medical dogs?

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,399
<i>You're smarter than him.</i>

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,074
<i>Think of something clever</i>
<i>to get him outta here.</i>

153
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,594
Hey, Todd.

154
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,992
What the hell? Did you just
throw something out into the hall?

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,918
- So, anyway, Elliot...
- Hey, I found an apartment.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,788
Great! You know,
but there's no rush for you to move out.

157
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,474
Are we gonna just live
with each other forever

158
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,109
and anytime we feel lonely
or vulnerable, we have hot sex?

159
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,112
- That would be stupid.
- We're both human,

160
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
so staying in that situation
would be a big mistake.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,911
I know.

162
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,708
<i>Sometimes when you're down, you end</i>
<i>up taking it out on the wrong person.</i>

163
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,519
- Going on vacation?
- Cos I'm a janitor,

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,717
so when I pack for vacation
I just pack cleaning supplies.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,234
- That's funny.
- I thought so.

166
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,836
Actually, I'm going to speak
at my son's career day.

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,478
About being a janitor?

168
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,516
You think there
aren't kids out there

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,989
that wanna grow up
to make the world sparkle?

170
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,470
- I didn't mean it that way.
- How did you mean it?

171
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,998
Look.

172
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,071
What the hell are you doing?

173
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,471
Dr Kelso,
will you just hear me out?

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,950
All I'm saying is that Miss Kaye
looks like she's in great shape.

175
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,477
Son, the woman is recovering
from major surgery on her...

176
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,549
- Brain.
- Dammit.

177
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,278
Why do I keep blanking on that?

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,351
Now, son,
give me the real skinny.

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,955
Did you pull her license or not?

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,473
Yes, sir, I did.

181
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,435
OK, I didn't tell her yet,
sir, but I swear I was gonna.

182
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,995
Well, Mr Corman,
how'd that go for you?

183
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,436
Horrible pain. I made sounds
like a dolphin giving birth.

184
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,637
Dr Cox, I think you should take
a look at Mr Corman's chart.

185
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,757
What's he got, scurvy?
There's no chance you were on a ship

186
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,196
- in the 1700s, is there?
- Just look at the damn chart.

187
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,032
What is it?

188
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,035
You're sick.

189
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,317
- Really?
- Really.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,878
<i>If I could get out of this place</i>
<i>and get away from Elliot</i>

191
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,430
<i>for a while,</i>
<i>I could regroup, you know?</i>

192
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,034
<i>But sometimes that's not so easy.</i>

193
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,270
- My truck was right there.
- Where is it now?

194
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,353
You'd have to ask
the guys who stole it.

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,398
Everything I owned
was in that truck.

196
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,550
JD, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

197
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,914
Gotta go. Good luck.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,911
Tallyho!

199
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,109
She was going,
like, 35 miles an hour.

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,239
All you saw was, like,
knuckles and a bun. Poor Bessie.

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,039
What kind of grown man
still names his car?

202
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,793
- You do.
- I've had Malik since I was 17.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,678
That's totally different.
Don't worry about Kelso.

204
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,558
- His wife can drive him.
- His wife hates him.

205
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,679
Morning, skipper.

206
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,716
I'm so dead.

207
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,916
Mr Corman,

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,709
I'm afraid you have
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,509
It is a very rare form of... cancer.

210
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,754
Yeah... I think I had that
in college once.

211
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,319
This is Dr Zeltzer.

212
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,834
He is the finest oncologist
we have on staff.

213
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,071
Really? You think so?

214
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
- Yeah, I do.
- Thank you.

215
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,759
- So, where do we start?
- Well, first off, we need to...

216
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,832
Better than Leventhal?

217
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,590
Leventhal's a quack.
You're the guy. You're the man.

218
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,275
- You can do it.
- Bless you.

219
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,557
That was some catch. The patient
shows almost no symptoms.

220
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,676
You called for
a bone marrow biopsy?

221
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,591
What made you
even think to do that?

222
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,875
How about he was
unbelievably annoying,

223
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,757
and I wanted to scare him so bad

224
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,513
that he'd never come back
in my hospital again?

225
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,479
Don't worry, Dr Zeltzer.
He's only kidding.

226
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,155
Stupid. See, that's where
Leventhal has the edge.

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,710
He would've got that.
The man's hilarious.

228
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,075
Of course, he wouldn't
be laughing so hard

229
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,628
if he knew
I was sleeping with his wife.

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,911
I don't know. I didn't know
it was just your patient.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,877
- What?
- Nothing.

232
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,758
- Then what's with the look?
- I have a crick in my neck.

233
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,673
Since I no longer have
any furniture for my new place,

234
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,557
I had to sleep
in my tub last night.

235
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,039
Oh, how was your date?

236
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,992
The Italian people are
really good at making sauce.

237
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,513
- Fantastic.
- You're such an ass.

238
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,319
Could you speak up?
Mr Roberts doesn't hear so well.

239
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,517
If you're looking for your beeswax,
it's not over here.

240
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,872
Now she all mad.

241
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,554
I needed your help last night
and you bailed on me.

242
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,915
You're the one that drew
all these lines up,

243
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,036
said that we're not
in a relationship.

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,953
JD, I wasn't looking
for a boyfriend last night.

245
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,600
I was looking for a friend.

246
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,272
I guess she told him.
Gotta go.

247
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,712
I was thinking about what
you said and you're right.

248
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,189
Kids don't wanna hear
about being a janitor.

249
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,111
- I never said that.
- It's OK.

250
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,316
Cos instead,
I'm gonna be a doctor.

251
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,119
I borrowed some stuff
from your locker, our locker.

252
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,475
And, listen,
if I don't get it back to you

253
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,358
within, like, two days,
consider it gone.

254
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,516
I am so sorry. Miss Kaye told me
about picking up her grandkids,

255
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,831
and she said she was feeling
fine, and I believed her.

256
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,390
Doctor, follow me. Son, have you
used drugs in the last 48 hours?

257
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,994
Oh, no, sir. Never use drugs.

258
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,799
Because this shot you're
about to get could kill you

259
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,270
- if mixed with narcotics.
- Oh, drugs. Yes, sir, all the time.

260
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,828
See? Waiting for the tox screen,
six hours.

261
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,310
Frightening the bejeebies
out of the riffraff, ten seconds.

262
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,118
Everybody lies, Dr Turk,

263
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,509
whether it's that
doobie brother in there,

264
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,672
or, say, me when I tell my son
he can still live at the house

265
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,639
after he graduates from art school.
And by the way, sport,

266
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,077
Mrs Kaye doesn't have
any grandchildren.

267
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,951
I'm still a virgin.

268
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,555
- You're pregnant.
- Again?

269
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,952
Since the bypass, doc,
nothing but salads.

270
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,837
Look, it was an accident.

271
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,514
My flashlight
didn't have any batteries.

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,637
So you decided
to put your penis in there?

273
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,151
Mr Corman, great news.

274
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,913
Dr Zeltzer and I have
gone over your test results

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,831
and your prognosis is excellent.

276
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,117
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

277
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,237
But you know what? Pat yourself
on the back all you want,

278
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,072
but I'm not an idiot.

279
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,116
I know that you were
screwing with me,

280
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,794
that I come in here
thinking I'm sick when I'm not.

281
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,269
But if you remember anything,
remember this.

282
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,238
If I didn't have cancer,
I could have been just some guy

283
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,788
looking for help
that you treated like crap.

284
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,791
Yeah.

285
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,914
The whole thing
is giving me an ulcer.

286
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,719
You wanna be tested
for that too, don't you?

287
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,189
Do you mind?

288
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,592
Hey, Elliot...
Look, you were right.

289
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,478
I should have been there
for you last night.

290
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,759
Thanks.

291
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,912
And I'm sorry you lost all your things.
That totally sucks.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,638
How are you holding up?

293
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,110
You know what?
It was just stuff. I'm fine.

294
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,916
This is good. It feels like
we've really turned a corner.

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,992
<i>Throw her down on that gurney</i>
<i>and mount her like a lion.</i>

296
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,071
I know.

297
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,194
- Why didn't you stop me?
- What?

298
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,919
Why did you let me
harass that guy?

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,230
You think the fact that
you got annoyed

300
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,915
and became insensitive with
another human being is my fault?

301
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,993
Yeah! Look, whenever I'm about
to do some stupid-ass stuff,

302
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,390
you're the one who calls me on it
and damn sure makes me stop.

303
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,837
That's the way it works.
That's the way it's worked for years.

304
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,832
Just exactly
what happened to that?

305
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,196
I guess I just don't get as good
a read on you as I used to.

306
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,475
Maybe all that therapy
has changed you.

307
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,358
Please, I'm crazier than ever.

308
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,718
During this entire conversation
I've actually been imagining myself

309
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,395
sitting on a throne between us,
watching all of this.

310
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,754
Maybe we're just not as close
as we used to be.

311
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,076
Maybe.

312
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,671
So you're just, like,
right here watching us?

313
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,117
No. Other side. Yeah.

314
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,998
I'm invisible to the naked eye.

315
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,991
Of course.

316
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,399
Why so sad, Chocolate Bear?

317
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,631
I just don't feel like going
back to that hospital, you know?

318
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,711
Yeah. Hey, is my breath OK?

319
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,268
I think Lisa and I
might try talking tonight.

320
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,828
That whole damn building
is packed with liars.

321
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,592
It is not.

322
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,711
Well, if the cut was that deep,

323
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,473
I'd probably just pull your arm off.

324
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,233
Once again...

325
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,871
Dr Jan ltor.
Dr Jan ltor.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,389
OK, maybe you're right.
But we're doctors.

327
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,152
That comes with the territory.

328
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,879
Some patients don't like
telling the whole truth.

329
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,679
Well, I don't get
why people have to do that.

330
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,558
I don't know,
maybe it's because they're proud.

331
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,837
Maybe it's cos they're scared.

332
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,037
You know what?
It was just stuff. I'm fine.

333
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,911
Maybe it's because
telling the truth

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,275
would make 'em
feel too vulnerable.

335
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,989
I guess. Dude, you're gonna
be late for Gift-Shop Girl.

336
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,275
Oh, my God.

337
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,158
<i>There are a few things</i>
<i>I've always believed in.</i>

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,389
<i>Flowers are good for any occasion.</i>

339
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,717
<i>Nothing is more important</i>
<i>than making time for an old friend.</i>

340
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,519
<i>Especially if the old girl's</i>
<i>seen better days.</i>

341
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,952
<i>Cos even if it breaks</i>
<i>your heart to be just friends,</i>

342
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,669
<i>if you really care about someone,</i>
<i>you'll take the hit.</i>

343
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,194
And it wasn't just stuff.

344
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,114
It was all of my yearbooks
and this little pink blanket

345
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,351
that my grandma
had crocheted for me and...

346
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,353
Oh, and my first love letter.
My first rag doll.

347
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,749
And I only had one picture of...

348
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,191
And my shoes!

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
