1
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:04,235
<i>As a doctor,</i>
<i>you need to be prepared for anything:</i>

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:07,049
<i>Heart attacks,</i>
<i>drug overdoses, gunshot wounds.</i>

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,285
<i>But one thing you can't prepare for</i>

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,135
<i>is what happens</i>
<i>after you break up with a co-worker.</i>

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,690
- Watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking.

6
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:18,598
<i>Get the last word in.</i>

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,551
- You watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking!

8
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:28,479
<i>Try as hard as you can to avoid them,</i>
<i>you're bound to run into 'em one day.</i>

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,891
<i>And the next day.</i>

10
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,812
<i>And the next day.</i>

11
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:46,194
- You don't even play sports.
- This helps me to relieve stress!

12
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,307
Feel better?

13
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,464
I do now.

14
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,958
- Girl problems?
- How'd you know?

15
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:02,968
You look like you got problems.
You're a girl.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,535
Hence, girl problems.
Watch your nails.

17
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:09,034
<i>The only positive is that</i>
<i>a hospital's like one big family.</i>

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,229
<i>So if one relationship ends,</i>
<i>there are others around you can rely on.</i>

19
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:17,361
- Dr Cox, I was wondering...
- I'd say you're about a B-cup.

20
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,676
At least they're real.

21
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,300
<i>Yep, it's a good place to heal.</i>

22
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,577
Look, Mom, I gotta go.

23
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,298
He did?

24
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,137
Yeah. All right. I love you too. Bye.

25
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:59,025
My high school teacher,
Mr Peters, died.

26
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,044
- Was a great guy.
- You OK?

27
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,471
<i>Even though I see death</i>
<i>all the time now,</i>

28
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,049
<i>I still react the same way</i>
<i>as when I was a kid.</i>

29
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,885
Doin' a lot better than Mr Peters.

30
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,073
- Dude.
- What's up, newbie?

31
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,049
My favourite
high school teacher just died.

32
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:20,326
The correct answer is, ''Nothing, sir''.

33
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,906
My God. Would you look at this hellhole?

34
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,568
If I see more broken-down equipment,

35
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:32,122
one more gomer shuffled back and forth
between some godforsaken home,

36
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,783
one more patient denied treatment

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,574
because they got
the wrong insurance, I...

38
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,162
There are times when
I concentrate as hard as I can

39
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:45,441
to see if I can
catch on fire like the Human Torch.

40
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:48,491
And mark my words, newbie,
if I ever pull it off,

41
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,296
I will be back here
to destroy this place.

42
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,567
I used to like the Silver Surfer.

43
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,944
- Hang ten! Hang...
- Get in here.

44
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:58,765
<i>After a while</i>
<i>you get used to Dr Cox's rants.</i>

45
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:01,523
And the lab tech
is nowhere to be found,

46
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,752
so I can't get that
tox screen I was looking for.

47
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,642
What do you say we write him
a friendly note?

48
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:09,439
''Dear

49
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,156
incompetent

50
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,980
dumb-ass.''

51
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:19,169
<i>The truth is, Dr Cox isn't really</i>
<i>angry, he's just amusing himself.</i>

52
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,593
<i>Maybe he's a little angry.</i>

53
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:28,932
We didn't need those.

54
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:31,074
So, all done?

55
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,725
He broke his pencil.

56
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:48,498
Turk, you'll be happy
you picked me to co-write this study.

57
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,714
Hell, yeah. I thought we'd start off
by having a couple of beers.

58
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,967
I got all the info
on peripheral vascular disease,

59
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,496
highlighted passages and coded them

60
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,283
to correspond with
the outline in your packet.

61
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,553
But I don't have a packet.

62
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,727
Look at that. Turk's packet.

63
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:08,180
- So you did this last night?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:12,756
- Why? What'd you do?
- Carla had to work, so I scarfed down

65
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:16,029
a bunch of fast food
and got back home at around seven.

66
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:20,480
Then I went to the bathroom at eight.
I got outta there at 11.15.

67
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,823
It was a good night!

68
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,311
I'm a nervous poo-er.

69
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,023
You are not gonna
believe what Dr Cox...

70
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,501
- It's you.
- Yeah. It's me.

71
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:38,081
<i>Could Turk have picked anyone</i>
<i>worse to be doing this project with?</i>

72
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:41,949
If this is a peripheral vascular
disease study,

73
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:46,981
then I'd exclude all claudication
patients not on pentoxifylline.

74
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,713
What're you lookin' at?

75
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,607
I'm gonna go to bed.

76
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:57,854
Elliot, are you gonna go with him?

77
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:01,154
Too early for jokes?
That's good to know.

78
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,652
It's good to know.

79
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,916
Interesting. It isn't often
I'm paged by a nurse.

80
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,649
The last time was when...

81
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,839
What was her name?
She hasn't worked here since.

82
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,970
Never mind. What can I do
for you and your coma patient?

83
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,700
I came across
Mr Rice's advance directive,

84
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:24,730
and he has a few requests
he would like us to honour.

85
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,172
Let's see.
Blinds open? That's done.

86
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,352
Incense burning?

87
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,842
Close enough. Glad you called.

88
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:40,109
Dr Kelso, he also wants to hear
Poison's <i>Talk Dirty to Me</i> once a day.

89
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,010
He wants to hear whose what?

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,201
Poison.
It's a heavy metal band.

91
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,893
Like Mötley Crüe and Winger.

92
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,081
My son was a bit of a headbanger.

93
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,138
- I'll get a tape deck in here...
- Nurse Espinosa, that's not necessary.

94
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:58,097
- It's just one song.
- It starts out as just one song.

95
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,148
But then half of the hospital staff

96
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:05,869
is piercing their genitalia
and fornicating in the back of vans.

97
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,267
Unless a family member
enforces the directive,

98
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,477
we don't have to do anything.

99
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,930
Now, will you do me a favour

100
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:17,074
and just forget about it,
sweetheart?

101
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,047
Of course.

102
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:23,278
Can you help me
locate one of his family members?

103
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:28,017
I could try to locate one through some
legal channels, but I'm really swamped.

104
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:30,811
I love your worry lines.
They're adorable.

105
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,000
They're like se<i>xy</i>
little forehead smiles.

106
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,575
Careful, I've been hurt before.

107
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,437
You won't believe
what happened yesterday.

108
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:43,521
Dr Cox went ballistic
and destroyed an entire lab room.

109
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:48,481
Broken computers, chairs
through windows, shattered beakers.

110
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,654
Beakers.
How is this is not good gossip?

111
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:54,899
JD, he does this every year.
And whatever you do,

112
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,710
don't get caught in his wake,
because he'll take you down.

113
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:01,262
Downtown.

114
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,366
All the way?

115
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,646
It's OK, boy. Who is it?

116
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:19,486
Little piggy, open up this door
or I will start huffing and puffing.

117
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,719
But, Dr Cox, I... OK!

118
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,284
Dear Lord,
please tell me that's not a onesie.

119
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,202
I'd invite you in...

120
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,034
- I've no interest in coming in.
- <i>Thank God.</i>

121
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,389
We're goin' out.

122
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,317
We can finish
the synopsis for chapter four,

123
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:44,574
and process the Stegemann data
if we pull an all-nighter.

124
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,703
- This isn't due for another month.
- But if we finish one week early,

125
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,111
we can play with fonts and margins.

126
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,606
Look...

127
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:57,838
Tonight's date night with Carla,
and I got on special underwear.

128
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,130
Go.

129
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,899
Would you mind if I keep working?

130
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,091
Yeah, that works for me.

131
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:11,806
I'm wearing special underwear too.
They're invisible.

132
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,103
Todd, I'm just kinda busy here.

133
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,314
No time for the Todd.

134
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,720
All the project geeks
are busy working tonight.

135
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,542
Excuse me?

136
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,899
All the surgical interns
picked a project geek from Medical

137
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:28,194
- to write our reports for us.
- I'm not a geek.

138
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,851
What's that on your finger?

139
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,798
It's a rubber thingy
to help me turn the pages...

140
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,997
...quicker.

141
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,035
She said ''rubber thingy''.

142
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:44,797
Excuse me, nurse.
I'm ready for my sponge bath.

143
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:47,133
I'm sorry, I can't.

144
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:49,586
I gotta pick up a CD
for this coma patient.

145
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:52,605
- But I'm wearing silk boxers.
- Turk...

146
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,330
The ones with the dogs
holding big money bags.

147
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,644
Sweetie, I love your money pants.

148
00:08:57,822 --> 00:09:01,178
It's just that I feel somebody
needs to take care of this guy.

149
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,605
How is it that you can blow me off
and it makes you sexier?

150
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,582
- Cos you're whipped.
- I thought so.

151
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,667
Thank you.

152
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,866
Minty.

153
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,642
So we're here.
What do you wanna talk about?

154
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,880
If you don't toss that shot back,
I'm gonna throw you

155
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:26,009
up on the bar and make you sing
the theme song from <i>Endless Love.</i>

156
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,360
- Yucky.
- Yucky?

157
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,656
I'm drinking with a mouseketeer.

158
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,374
Two more.

159
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,841
If you're not gonna talk to me, what's
the point of sitting alone in a bar?

160
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,314
You know,
that's a good point. It is.

161
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:52,259
Excuse me, ladies. Do you know anybody
who might like a couple of free drinks?

162
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,288
Hello, ladies.

163
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,461
Yes, it's a onesie.

164
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,911
Great news. I'm back for the night.

165
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,897
You know what?

166
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,006
The hell with you, Chris Turk.

167
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,389
What the hell got into her?

168
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:20,799
Wassup!

169
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,838
Could you turn that off, please?

170
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,754
What?

171
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:41,592
I thought I told you not to play
that in the house... Hospital.

172
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,239
I'm just trying
to do right by my patient.

173
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:47,226
As of this moment,
he is no longer your patient.

174
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,342
- Dr Kelso, you...
- Young lady,

175
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:53,396
when I asked you to leave it alone,
I wasn't really asking you.

176
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:57,400
It's like when I ask the paperboy
to avoid hitting my rosebushes.

177
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,562
I'm saying you damn well better do it

178
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:03,770
or I'm going to forget
to put the chain on Baxter.

179
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:07,743
Now get on out of here
and take that boom blaster with you!

180
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,727
My relationship with Jeremy was
emotionally over before he ended it.

181
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,638
Then I graduated from college
and met Ethan.

182
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,794
You don't say?

183
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:23,395
We had two good years
and two bad years, but not all at once.

184
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,431
Of course.

185
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:30,771
Dr Cox, don't get me wrong.

186
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:34,452
Love getting drunk in my jammies
just as much as the next guy,

187
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,723
but it's late, so...

188
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,491
Thanks for coming out, newbie.

189
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,490
Hope this whole thing
wasn't too yucky for you.

190
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,448
You seem fine, so I'm...

191
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:48,329
I am not fine.

192
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:52,766
Why do you think we're out
here at this bar at two in the morning?

193
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,836
Just so we can go in the urinal
and piss on the ice?

194
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,111
I love to melt the middle.

195
00:11:58,294 --> 00:12:01,127
We're out here because
if I go home and go to sleep,

196
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:06,093
the only thing I'll be able to think
about is I gotta go back to that place.

197
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:09,058
And you wanna know something?

198
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,379
I got nothing.

199
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:14,674
Honest to God,
I got nothing. I'm cooked.

200
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,417
You owe me $53.

201
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:32,378
I think I left my wallet
in my other onesie.

202
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,397
The bartender
let you skip out on the tab?

203
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:43,419
He said I could pay him back
by giving him a physical,

204
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:46,384
which is scary because
I never said I was a doctor.

205
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,425
I warned you about
getting caught up in Dr Cox's wake.

206
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,231
- Does he listen?
- You'd think so with those ears.

207
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,387
Uncalled for.

208
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,867
It's different.
He showed up at my place.

209
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,335
He showed up at my house.

210
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:02,154
- Showed up at my mama's.
- Ruined my wedding.

211
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,118
I know you think
he's gonna shake this off,

212
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,356
but I connected with the guy,
and there is no way

213
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,802
he'll walk in with a big smile.

214
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,985
What do you say, sports fans?
It's a great day!

215
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,263
Elliot, Todd has
something to say to you.

216
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,976
Todd?

217
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:29,521
Turk never told me
you were his project geek.

218
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,957
- And?
- You look really hot eating that egg.

219
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,631
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,047
- OK? Are we?
- No.

221
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,594
Look at me and tell me I'm not a geek.

222
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:50,486
- You still got that rubber thingy on.
- Eggs can be extremely slippery.

223
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,526
You scared the hell outta me.

224
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,695
I'm sorry. That always happens.

225
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:01,307
No one ever expects
me to be anywhere.

226
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,411
Aw, Ted.

227
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,237
She knows your name.

228
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:11,655
So, I found your coma patient's
relative you were looking for.

229
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:15,317
Thank you!
Thank you so much.

230
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,069
Don't let go.

231
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,613
- What?
- Nothing.

232
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,769
I'll acknowledge there
have been occasions during my tenure...

233
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,014
What do you think you're doing?

234
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:29,901
Apologising to Franklyn
for breaking his favourite microscope.

235
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:33,749
You can't cry on my shoulder
then pretend nothing happened.

236
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:37,222
All right. First of all,
Franklyn, there was no crying.

237
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,966
Say it.

238
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,873
- No crying.
- Good boy.

239
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,395
And you should give some thought

240
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,973
to purchasing some
non-bunching panties.

241
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,123
They give you the extra support

242
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:51,733
while protecting against those lines
underneath your scrubs.

243
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,765
- I get it. I'm a girl.
- Franklyn, you heard it. Say it.

244
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,881
- He's a girl.
- Good boy.

245
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,366
You can't play with people's
emotions cos you feel like it.

246
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,559
OK, newbie, I'm now going
to give you an opportunity

247
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,569
to get out of here
before I grab you by your ankles

248
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:09,083
and redecorate Franklyn's lab.

249
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,346
Please go.

250
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:15,753
We're back.
The clique is back together!

251
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,625
That is what
I'm talkin' about. Shall we?

252
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,861
Let's do this.

253
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:33,354
Let's get back to work.

254
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,065
But it's gonna be different this time.

255
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:40,141
If we take a systematic approach,
we'll maximise our efficiency.

256
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,302
I rented <i>Red Dawn.</i>

257
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,228
Wolverines!

258
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,353
Dr Kelso, this is Matthew Rice.

259
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,523
He's the pro<i>xy</i>
for his uncle's living will.

260
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,611
What a happy coincidence,

261
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:56,054
you showing up
out of the clear blue sky.

262
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,352
- Oh, God.
- You're OK.

263
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:01,765
So, exactly how much is my uncle
leaving me? Can I ask that?

264
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:04,226
This isn't about his assets.

265
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:07,248
This is about executing
his last living requests.

266
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,848
So no money at all?

267
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,275
Not a dime, kiddo.

268
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:15,103
I can't tell you how glad we are

269
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:17,576
to put all this tomfoolery to rest.

270
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:20,833
Once and for all.
Cup of coffee, sport?

271
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:26,718
What happened? I blacked out.

272
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,075
When you rolled out of bed this morning,
did you say to yourself,

273
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:36,834
''Hey! I think today would be
a terrific day to commit hari-kari''?

274
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,105
That's what you're doing.

275
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,639
You don't deal with problems
the way emotionally healthy people do.

276
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,179
Well, hold on
a second there, Rainbow.

277
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,682
This just off the news wire:
You're not licensed to comment

278
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:51,113
on how people deal with their emotions.

279
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:54,890
- I beg to differ.
- Well, at least I let mine go. You?

280
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:57,600
If you ever were able to actually

281
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,952
release all the tensions
that are bottled up inside of you,

282
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,774
what would that look like?
How would that go?

283
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,898
How you like me now, bitch?

284
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:14,462
Maybe I just don't
have anything bottled up.

285
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,713
What happened to that teacher
you were prattling on about?

286
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,066
- Passed away.
- Croaksville. That's what I thought.

287
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:26,436
What did you do
when you found out that he'd died?

288
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:30,020
- I made a joke.
- I sure hope it was a good one.

289
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:33,323
Here's the inside scoop.
Life's hard enough,

290
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:36,538
and there's no way
you can survive in a dump like this

291
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,555
unless you find a way
to get your emotions out.

292
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,352
Fact.

293
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:45,710
Well, I let my emotions out!
I'll show you some of this!

294
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:50,953
Franklyn, I am so sorry.

295
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,795
Wanna wear my stethoscope?

296
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,978
The cool thing about this movie
is that this could really happen.

297
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:03,549
The Russians invading,
or C Thomas Howell being a tough guy?

298
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,012
Both.

299
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:12,081
Wolverines.
Why is she always here?

300
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,768
We're working on my study.

301
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,760
Every time I come here
I'm gonna see him.

302
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,638
Just get someone else
to do this project with you.

303
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:23,482
Maybe the reason
why I asked you to work with me

304
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,352
is because it would
force you to see each other.

305
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,946
I don't want to get
back together with him.

306
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:32,658
I'm not saying that.
You made a terrible couple.

307
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:35,047
It's just that...
I like you. You know?

308
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,382
I think you're a cool person.

309
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,036
It doesn't matter about me and JD.

310
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:43,195
- You and I can still hang out.
- No.

311
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,080
It can't be that way,
and you know it.

312
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,480
Cos that's my best friend.

313
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,495
So, either you can try and fix it, or...

314
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,689
- This sucks.
- Yeah.

315
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:03,761
<i>And baby we'll be</i>

316
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:07,200
<i>At the drive-in</i>

317
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:11,344
<i>In the old man's Ford</i>

318
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:15,914
<i>Behind the bushes</i>

319
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,787
<i>Till I'm screaming for more</i>

320
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:26,025
<i>Down the basement</i>

321
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:30,196
<i>Lock the cellar door</i>

322
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:33,764
<i>And baby</i>

323
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,277
<i>Talk dirty to</i>

324
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:41,663
<i>Me</i>

325
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,367
- I love you.
- What?

326
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:48,306
<i>Know that we'll be</i>

327
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,631
<i>At the drive-in...</i>

328
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:57,538
What are you doing?

329
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:01,326
This is a recommendation letter
from a high school teacher of mine.

330
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,764
He's actually

331
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:06,858
the reason I got into medicine.

332
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,634
And he died last week.

333
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,102
I'm so sorry, JD.

334
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:14,279
I really am.

335
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:21,828
Do you wanna be alone?

336
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:23,678
No.

337
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,911
You wanna cry a little?

338
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,347
No.

339
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:35,853
Wanna go throw stuff off the roof
like Letterman used to do?

00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:45,093
You see, it's the pudding
that splatters the best,

341
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:50,349
because it's the pudding, and therefore
I say let the pudding pop fall!

342
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,492
- Who is that? Arsenio?
- No.

344
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,724

<i>bottled up inside them.</i>

345

Dr Dorian,

347
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,406
Thank you, Dr Reid.

348
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:08,423
OK, guys.

00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:11,711
One, two, three.

350
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,461
<i>It felt really good.</i>

351
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,402
Player.

352
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,781
The horror.
