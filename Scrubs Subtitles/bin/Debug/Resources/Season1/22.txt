1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,597
You ever notice how a tumour
looks just like cheese?

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,833
Is that good cocktail conversation?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,727
This patient today
thought he had blood in his stool.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,804
Turned out to be pimento.

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,170
What? I worked on a homeless
guy who vomited up a mitten.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,987
That won't stop me
from wearing mine when it's cold.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,180
What's wrong with you? We have
a good bottle of wine, we all look nice.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,673
Can we talk about something
other than work? Please?

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,887
Name an actress.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,830
JD can tell you which movie
she appeared in naked.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,151
I'm gonna go put on my pyjamas.

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,558
Can't believe
I shaved my legs for this.

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,023
Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan,
Jennifer Connelly.

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,563
<i>Boys on the Side, The Doors,</i>
and as for Ms Connelly,

15
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,904
topless in <i>Inventing the Abbotts,</i>
bottomless in <i>Requiem For a Dream,</i>

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,361
and in <i>The Hot Spot,</i>
you gotta love her,

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,110
frontal and tush-tush.

18
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,420
- Oh, my God!
- You the man.

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,188
<i>That's the thing about</i>
<i>best friends. They just get each other.</i>

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,314
You usually get uncomfortable
hugging a guy right about now.

21
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,236
Bring it, baby.

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,914
This isn't gonna end well.
I used to wrestle in college.

23
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,963
Oh! You broke the hug!

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,227
So you working
on a house or what?

25
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,685
Yeah, I scored this
big restoration job.

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,108
So who's the fan club?

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,920
Neat hug.

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,154
Newbie, no one likes a looky-loo.

29
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,167
Not now, not ever.

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,727
What's that,
your lucky board or something?

31
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,074
That? Oh, that's a nail gun accident.

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,931
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,531
I dosed him with morphine,
and the nail went straight through,

34
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,164
so it's not that big a d...

35
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,698
Dear God, she's getting woozy.
Quickly, show her the bloody side.

36
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,609
- Look. Touch the nail.
- Yeah!

37
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,447
Wanna touch it? Touch the nail.
Touch my nail! Touch it!

38
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,412
- Lick the tip of my...
- Good night!

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,207
- Let's get you to a hand surgeon.
- What about tough guy?

40
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,519
Somebody'll get her.

41
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,583
- Bye-bye.
- Please don't.

42
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,654
I can't get over it. Who faints?
No one's fainted since the '40s.

43
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,801
You're a doctor. You shouldn't
have to look at that stuff.

44
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,293
I was surprised.
I don't like surprises.

45
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,070
Oh, my goodness!

46
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,067
Pictures capture moments in time.

47
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,892
When they're posed, they're not real.
I hate that whole, like... thing.

48
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,593
That's why at a party, you see
me in the bushes with my camera.

49
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,387
- You're a little weird, aren't you?
- A little bit.

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,255
Ben, look what the cat tried to drag in
before it was skinned and eaten.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,569
Meow.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,099
Still with the annoying camera?

53
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,766
She just skip the part where
people say hello to each other?

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,966
Hello, Benji.
You look very pale.

55
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,373
I miss the sweet talk.

56
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,752
Maybe it's been too long.
Maybe my feelings were hurt a little.

57
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,886
''Feelings.'' That's a good one.

58
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,131
You're a big girl.
When you got divorced,

59
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,147
you put people in the awkward position
of choosing between you and Perry.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,118
You're my brother!

61
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,350
Well, admittedly, that made
it harder. Ooh, good one!

62
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,334
''Me so cranky!''

63
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,475
Patient's name is Mo Weinberg. Cancer
is confined to the right testicle.

64
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,342
Dr Turk will be
assisting with the removal.

65
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,659
Sorry, Mo. Looks like you're
about to lose Larry or Curly.

66
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,364
Starting the incision.

67
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,859
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.
I'm guessing Mr Weinberg is Jewish.

68
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,609
- Yeah, so?
- Why isn't he circumcised?

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,937
<i>A recent medical study found</i>

70
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>that a mistake is made</i>
<i>on 20 percent of all patients.</i>

71
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,257
<i>Most of these</i>
<i>are clerical and harmless,</i>

72
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,555
<i>but it still adds up</i>
<i>to a lot of near misses.</i>

73
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,928
Dr Wen asks
if there could be a mix-up,

74
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,899
because our appendicitis patient,
that dude doesn't have an appendix.

75
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,828
Oh, wait right here.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,173
Wow.

77
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,206
I know. You know,
we almost did... Whoa!

78
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,724
What's goin' on here?

79
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,187
No, Mom, I don't care what
my third grade teacher is up to.

80
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,268
And scene. How are you?

81
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,862
I haven't
seen you since your breakdown.

82
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,011
Oh, which one?

83
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,175
Oh. So...

84
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,309
What's new?

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,596
Last time I saw you
I was really stressed.

86
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,685
The weight of the world
on my shoulders.

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,851
- So guess what I did.
- Quit your job?

88
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,704
Flushed my fish down the toilet.
No more feedings, no more bowl cleaning,

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,417
no more being judged
for having a second glass of wine.

90
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,086
Don't even get me
started on judgmental fish.

91
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,644
But that sent me on this whole
shame spiral, so I decided to travel.

92
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,912
I got hit on in Venice.
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

93
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,198
For about ten minutes.
It's very steep.

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,496
Then I went to Florida
to swim with Dolphins.

95
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,551
- Oh.
- And I don't mean the fish.

96
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,278
There was an NFL thing
going on at the hotel.

97
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,622
- You.
- I almost forgot! I'm engaged!

98
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,205
There used to be a ring,
but my fiancé did some soul-searching

99
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,031
and we decided that it needed
to be a little more fancy.

100
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,741
Oh, you have no idea
how happy this makes me.

101
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,615
The only reason you're
vomiting and exhausted is...

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,414
Well, you're pregnant.

103
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,606
N... I'm what now?

104
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,901
Yeah, pregnant!
Your fiancé's gonna be so happy!

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,874
My fiancé and I decided not to
have sex until we were married.

106
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,876
So he's not gonna be so happy.

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,752
More curious, really, than happy.

108
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,838
You'll want to rewrap
the gauze when it gets soiled.

109
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,245
Rewrap a dirty bandage. It's phenomenal

110
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,463
how you doctors keep
all this in your head.

111
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,788
We don't.
It says it right there on the box.

112
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,283
Look, right there. Hey, don't be
mean to him. You're mad at me.

113
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,592
You shouldn't do contracting. You're
clumsy. That's why these things happen.

114
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,845
They don't.

115
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,542
How many times have you hurt
yourself with that nail gun?

116
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,487
- Once. What?
- Oh, come on.

117
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,122
That's a new nail gun.
If it'd been any other,

118
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,473
the estimate
would be slightly higher.

119
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,615
It's not funny.

120
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,378
You're pretty when you're mad.

121
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,292
<i>I guess sibling rivalry never goes away,</i>
<i>no matter how old you get.</i>

122
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,136
What is this? That doesn't hurt.

123
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,850
- Doesn't hurt. Doesn't hurt.
- Oh, really?

124
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,527
OK, that kind of smarts a little bit.

125
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:36,234
- Jordan, I'll call later. All right?
- OK. Fine. Forget it. Forget it.

126
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,000
You big jerk.

127
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,708
You happen to remember
when she used to be fun?

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,253
- No.
- Me neither.

129
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,630
Me neither.

130
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,736
When spoken to, newbie.
When spoken to.

131
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,825
I thought we were clear on that one.

132
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,795
We haven't grabbed a beer
in weeks. What's that about?

133
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,386
<i>He's never asked me</i>
<i>to grab a beer, but I don't care.</i>

134
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,103
Would you like to come?

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,570
Oh, God, yes.

136
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,224
To buddies!

137
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,495
What do you think you're doing?

138
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,745
You can't drink. You're our driver.
That's why we brought you.

139
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,526
That's just not right.

140
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,146
Well, I'm gonna drink this
for both of us.

141
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,119
Can't stop thinking
about Mr Weinberg's testicles.

142
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,027
Dude.

143
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,829
I mean, I almost
removed one of them, Todd.

144
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,857
- Which one?
- Like it matters.

145
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,222
Oh, it matters.

146
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,718
- Bye, Todd.
- OK!

147
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,899
Dr Turk, I heard about
your mishap earlier today,

148
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,471
but here's the skinny.

149
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,169
If that patient finds out what happened
because you can't rein in your yapper,

150
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,645
then heads will roll, and I promise,

151
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,268
yours and Ted's
will be the first to go!

152
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,020
What did I do?

153
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,324
Consider my lips sewn shut, sir.
Which, in this hospital, could happen.

154
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,151
Young man!

155
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,421
At Sacred Heart,
we do not make mistakes.

156
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,312
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

157
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,711
I wouldn't have slept
with someone else

158
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,808
if I didn't love you so much.

159
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,292
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop! Hang up the phone!

160
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,316
Hold on one second.
Hold on! Hi!

161
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,326
Your last name is Tracy!
Of course you know that,

162
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,254
but there's a woman in 308
whose first name is Tracy.

163
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,447
I started thinking about your urine
and how you stay well-hydrated,

164
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,177
which is why your pee
is lighter than most people's,

165
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,812
and the sample with your name on
was bright yellow,

166
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,520
and the other Tracy
is not much of a water drinker,

167
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,231
which is why I think
her skin looks so pasty.

168
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,702
Get to the point.

169
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,555
You're not pregnant!
The lab tech just switched the samples.

170
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,095
You're killin' me.

171
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,706
Hey, sweetie, you know I was joking
about all that stuff, right?

172
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,416
Kim Basinger.

173
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,718
Please. <i>Nine 1/2 Weeks.</i>

174
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,575
Winona Ryder.

175
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,014
Never naked,
but just a hint of nipple

176
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,076
in <i>How to Make an American Quilt.</i>

177
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,473
Good. At last, a worthy foe.

178
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,618
Oh, chalk boy?

179
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,939
''Chalk boy.''

180
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,084
If you could chalk it without
pleasuring it, that'd be terrific.

181
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,526
What?

182
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,904
You're going
for that gruff doctor routine,

183
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,085
but you just come off
sounding like a cartoon pirate.

184
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:19,264
''Gladys. Chalk it!
Don't pleasure it!''

185
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,712
''Here's what we're gonna do.''

186
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,294
Are ya done?

187
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,315
Yeah, I'm done.

188
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,393
Yeah, I think you are too.

189
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,398
Come on. Let him have a little fun.

190
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,048
All right, Clara.

191
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,756
You can order yourself a Cosmopolitan.

192
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,939
We'll just grab a cab home.

193
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,349
Actually, Ben's been sneaking me beers
all night, and I'm quite drunk.

194
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,578
That's just great.

195
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,298
Hey, Ben, what...

196
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,292
Why is this hand still bleeding?

197
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,340
I don't know.

198
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,737
It's weird.
I cut myself shaving last week

199
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,724
and it wouldn't stop bleeding.

200
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,443
<i>One thing that</i>
<i>sucks about being a doctor</i>

201
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,710
<i>is that you never miss a red flag.</i>

202
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,087
Can I have you over here
for two seconds?

203
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,748
What the hell are you doing?

204
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,933
- Humour me. It's probably mono.
- The kissing disease?

205
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,105
- Yeah.
- Score.

206
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,712
Your only job today is to get
his test results back, you understand?

207
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,903
Hey, guys!

208
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,429
See, now that's real.

209
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,327
She wasn't pregnant after all.
Some idiot mislabelled her sample.

210
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,368
I was a heartbeat away from giving
an appendix patient a crotch lobotomy.

211
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,777
If I do my best and I lose a patient.
I can live with that.

212
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,917
But if a clerical error is the reason
a guy's walking around

213
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,649
with ''only the lonely,'' damn,
that don't sit well with the big dog.

214
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,511
I'm with you, big dog.

215
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,594
<i>I was paged because Ben's</i>
<i>blood work was finally ready.</i>

216
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,040
<i>Unfortunately, the chart</i>
<i>wasn't in the out box.</i>

217
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,902
<i>I'd knock, but the haematopathologist</i>
<i>is the meanest,</i>

218
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,302
<i>intern-hating-est</i>
<i>monster in this hospital.</i>

219
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,396
Don't be a chicken. If you need
something, go in and get it.

220
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,823
Excuse me, sir...

221
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,537
I'll come back later.

222
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,742
<i>The haematopathologist was the last</i>
<i>person I wanted to deal with.</i>

223
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>Why do you have to jump</i>
<i>out and scare me all the time?</i>

224
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:18,284
I don't jump out and scare you.
I follow you around all day.

225
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,870
I only got an hour-and-a-half
worth of work.

226
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,411
The rest of the time,
I track you, like an animal.

227
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,272
You're kidding, right?

228
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,872
I don't know. Am I?

229
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,508
<i>What? How did that get there?</i>

230
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,834
- <i>Come on, good news.</i>
- Hey, Bambi.

231
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,029
Are you OK?

232
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,357
<i>Leukaemia.</i>

233
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,166
No.

234
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,659
<i>When you deliver</i>
<i>horrible news to someone,</i>

235
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,039
<i>the walk to their door</i>
<i>can seem an eternity.</i>

236
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,569
Thank you, nice nurse.

237
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,767
- Ben, why?
- Cos it's my thing.

238
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,329
You're just jealous
cos you don't have a thing.

239
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,959
I had a thing.
I used to like to hike.

240
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,026
But Jordan somehow
got that in the divorce too.

241
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,151
She got your hobby?
That's vindictive.

242
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,687
Look, Ben, I know I am prone to
making the occasional casual reference

243
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:32,234
to your sister being a...
Well, a wire-haired man-goblin.

244
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,093
But I hope that has no effect
on your relationship.

245
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,490
It's very sweet of you
to think that you're that important.

246
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,390
- Draw on three.
- Oh, yeah.

247
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,908
One, two, three, draw.

248
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,222
You are in serious trouble.

249
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,792
What? What?

250
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,654
Hey, new friend.

251
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,089
Oh, Janice, are those the test results
we've been waiting for?

252
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,274
<i>Wait a sec,</i>
<i>first Turk's patient, then Elliot's.</i>

253
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,717
<i>This is a mistake. I just,</i>
<i>I feel it in my gut. I'm sure of it.</i>

254
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,620
Hello, Janice?

255
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,459
No, this is some...
You know, that lab is backed up again,

256
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,783
and so I'm gonna...
It's a little while.

257
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,755
- All right. Terrific to see you. Bye.
- Go.

258
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,632
I know who screwed this up.

259
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,548
It's that same lazy-ass nurse
that mixed up my files.

260
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,988
- There she is. I'm gonna go get her.
- I can fight my own battles.

261
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,130
You're gonna write an angry note?
She doesn't deserve it.

262
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,020
- I lost my thesaurus.
- You go get her then.

263
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,175
Hello... Nancy.

264
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,868
Hi, how... Could you check,
there's a very important file I...

265
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,745
You know what?
This actually means, ''in a minute.''

266
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,615
Tag me in.
I am oiled-up and ready to go.

267
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,539
She said a minute,
so I'm sure that in a minute...

268
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,014
Now it's two. You're in.

269
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,390
Thank you. My friend needs
you to check on the Ben Sullivan file,

270
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,619
and you're gonna do it
right now. Why?

271
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,624
Because you are not gonna drop
the ball like you did on my patient.

272
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,790
- You said, ''Drop the ball.''
- I know, totally by accident.

273
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,004
- Chop-chop, Nancy.
- <i>Rápido.</i>

274
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,528
Hey there, buddy!

275
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,556
- How is my best friend doing?
- You and I hardly know each other.

276
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,729
These aren't my words.

277
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:19,011
Hello, Dr Dorian.
Let's take a ride.

278
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,268
So, word has it you've been doing
a little fishing in these here parts,

279
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,249
trying to catch yourself
a prize-winning mistake.

280
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,643
No, sir, I just...

281
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,423
I was sure your little buddy in Surgery

282
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,772
would've shared with you my most
important rule here at Sacred Heart.

283
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,430
Tell him my most important rule, Ted.

284
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,540
Too much ''ha-ha,''
pretty soon ''boo-hoo.''

285
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,356
My other rule.

286
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:48,024
If you don't look for a mistake,
you can't find one.

287
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,977
That's right, Teddy bear.

288
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,254
Now, stop looking for trouble

289
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:59,073
just because you like this patient,
and face the facts.

290
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,712
Remove him, Ted.

291
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,445
That ''ha-ha'' rule is true.

292
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,445
I'm just asking you to check
and see if you could've made a mistake.

293
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,217
In seven years,
I've never made a mistake.

294
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,087
You mixed up my patients'
urine samples yesterday!

295
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,284
I make lots of mistakes. But I
have to go to the bathroom now.

296
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,336
- After that, I'm going to lunch.
- Franklyn...

297
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,572
- Can you help me out here?
- What do you want me to do, cry?

298
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,361
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

299
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,868
Give me a second
to think of something sad.

300
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,622
- Quickly.
- OK, that's not helping.

301
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,041
I shouldn't have
put you in this position.

302
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,461
Oh, there we go. Another
man in my life, trying to protect me.

303
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,205
Stay with it, Elliot.

304
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,591
Everyone thinks I can't take criticism

305
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,611
because mom and dad
give nothing but.

306
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,250
- Good, this is good.
- Look where it's gotten me.

307
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, I'm 26,
single and all I do is work.

308
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,364
You know, I may as well just give up
the idea of being in a healthy and...

309
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,743
...happy relationship
and just go ahead and...

310
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,715
And... And...

311
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,596
Become your mother?

312
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,148
Yeah.

313
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,508
Check Mr Sullivan's tests again.

314
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,594
OK.

315
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,365
How cool was that?

316
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,480
Why so sad, Bambi?

317
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,528
Because so far
no one's screwed up.

318
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,051
The clerk didn't make a mistake,
or the lab technician.

319
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,875
Maybe I'm just an idiot.
I don't know.

320
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,351
Let me ask you something.

321
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,577
You're kind of a boob guy, right?

322
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,658
Excuse me?

323
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,579
I can tell. I've seen you look at mine.
Not in a sleazy way, or anything.

324
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,351
This is the most uncomfortable
conversation I've had.

325
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,584
- You want to touch one?
- I stand corrected.

326
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,476
You're my best friend's girlfriend.

327
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:55,948
So your instinct is to pass
on this fantastic one-time offer?

328
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,177
- I'm afraid so.
- I'm up here, Bambi.

329
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,625
Oh, sorry.

330
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,646
With Ben, it's one of two things.

331
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,929
Either your instincts
are right or your brain

332
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,382
is trying to protect you
from something.

333
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,560
You have pretty good instincts.
Trust them.

334
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,895
What am I supposed to do though?

335
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,792
You know there's only
one more person to talk to.

336
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,949
<i>The haematopathologist.</i>

337
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,744
Hello?

338
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,190
- Call me Dr Bobb.
- You go by your first name?

339
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,492
- Nope. First name's Fred.
- Fred Bobb?

340
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,739
What can I do you for?

341
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,270
Hi, I was hoping that you could
recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.

342
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,305
Well that depends, young man.

343
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,381
Do you think I made a mistake
or do you just wish I did?

344
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:39,033
- I kind of wish you did.
- Then I'll do it.

345
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,563
Sorry there,
giant '70s security guard guy.

346
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,329
- Cold out here, huh?
- Yes.

347
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,080
Yeah. You could hang
a friggin' raincoat off my nipples.

348
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,394
Left one at least.
The right one's just a little shy.

349
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:59,053
- Sticking with the weird thing?
- It works for me.

350
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,245
Listen, you guys
wouldn't be keeping me here

351
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:06,496
if there wasn't something
potentially wrong with me, would you?

352
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,984
No, we wouldn't.

353
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:14,208
Hey, how come this guy is always
following you in the pictures?

354
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,222
- Oh, my God.
- Him.

355
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,308
Want to see the rest
of the pictures I took today?

356
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,475
- Look at that one.
- These are good, man.

357
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,563
Ben, good news, man.

358
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,984
Let's get a picture together.

359
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,275
- OK.
- Come on.

360
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,014
<i>It was weird how everyone</i>
<i>came to see Ben off.</i>

361
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,276
Everybody in.

362
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,932
<i>He'd only been here one day and there</i>
<i>wasn't even anything wrong with him.</i>

363
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,347
Why take a picture like that?
You said posed pictures aren't real.

364
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:22,871
Come on, JD.
None of this is real. You know that.

365
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,848
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.

366
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:32,304
Stop looking for trouble
just because you like this patient,

367
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,480
and face the facts.

368
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,167
Either your instincts are right
or your brain is trying to protect you.

369
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,757
Do you actually think I made
a mistake or do you just wish I did?

370
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,144
I kind of wish you did.

371
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,638
Janice!

372
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,870
Over here, big guy.

373
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:05,527
Let's try this again.
Are those the test results?

374
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,594
Yeah.

375
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,792
Ben, you have leukaemia.

376
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,380
That sucks.

377
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,512
Yeah.

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
