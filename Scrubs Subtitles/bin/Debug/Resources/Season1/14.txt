1
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:05,741
<i>When you're crazy about someone,</i>

2
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,368
<i>even waking up isn't so bad any more.</i>

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,792
Good morning.

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,815
<i>The air feels crisper,</i>
<i>the sun seems brighter.</i>

5
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:18,105
<i>Even your morning breath smells good.</i>

6
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:22,110
- You taste like old eggs.
- I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,801
I love old eggs.

8
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:33,019
You are so different
from the guys I usually go out with.

9
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:37,083
- How so?
- For starters,

10
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,218
I'm still wearing pants.

11
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:42,182
That is because I respect you.

12
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,786
Yeah?

13
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,968
And also, this triple knot,
I couldn't get out.

14
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:49,698
Thanks for being so patient with me.

15
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:52,250
I hope you don't think I'm a big tease.

16
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,988
I just love sleeping
in the same bed with you.

17
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,385
I've never slept better.

18
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:06,108
Me neither.

19
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:09,403
I'll go ahead and say it.
I hope we never have sex.

20
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:14,617
What would you say if I told you
that I feel ready right now?

21
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:23,865
- Whatever.
- Then I think tonight...

22
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,530
Tonight is good,
but now also good.

23
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:29,362
Now works. Sure.

24
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:36,695
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,097
- Get out!
- 7.15, ya'll. Gotta go to work.

26
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:59,931
<i>Since Alex is a social worker,</i>
<i>she's here a lot.</i>

27
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:03,681
<i>For some guys, that would be</i>
<i>distracting, but I'm staying focused.</i>

28
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:06,316
You're on my foot.

29
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:09,107
I'm so sorry.

30
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:13,540
Please step on my foot.
I'm just waiting for an excuse.

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,048
- Not today.
- Really? Why not?

32
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,251
I get it. Nice pull.
You slept with her yet?

33
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:29,703
What? I am not discussing that with you.

34
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,183
- That's a no.
- Listen, Jolly Green.

35
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:35,091
People's personal lives are just that,
personal.

36
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,328
That's a definite no.

37
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,349
Good to see you again, Mr Barnes.
We'll be with you in a moment.

38
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,424
Put him in bed six.

39
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:49,345
Laverne, are you
in fact part golden retriever?

40
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:51,111
Keep it holy now.

41
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:55,782
Because every time I toss this guy,
you bring him right back to me.

42
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,179
All right, Will & Grace. Breakdown.

43
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,110
With his elevated lipase,
I'd say pancreatitis.

44
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,149
Grace, you wanna finish?

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,073
- Start with a Demerol drip...
- The throbbing's back.

46
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,398
Admitted for substance abuse
three times in the past year.

47
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,928
- But he said he quit.
- The addict said he quit?

48
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:15,119
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

49
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,282
- That changes everything.
- I believe in Mr Barnes.

50
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,414
Just because you have
a new girlfriend doesn't mean

51
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,702
that the world has suddenly
turned into a giant green M&M.

52
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:27,041
The Red Sox still suck, they do.

53
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,337
Barbie here still can't decide
what to do with those annoying bangs,

54
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,034
and addicts everywhere
will still lie to get a fix.

55
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,785
Now, you've got to wake up, sweetheart.
You're gonna be late for school...

56
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,215
You wet the bed.

57
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:45,950
Why can't I have a normal child
without these problems?

58
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,897
My mom says they frame my face.

59
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,942
They don't.

60
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:57,519
Wait, please wait, wait

61
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:58,977
Go, bus.

62
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,117
Go. Go.

63
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,597
She didn't see you, Bob.
Just stay perfectly still.

64
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,322
Dr Kelso!

65
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:26,597
- Can I get a ride to the hospital?
- Of course, dear. Glad to do it.

66
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,700
Dr Cox and I have been friends for
a long time. You should get to know him.

67
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,937
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to.

68
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:49,213
In case you were wondering,

69
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:54,583
it says, ''if you can read this,
you're standing too close''.

70
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,799
I wasn't trying to look.

71
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:02,367
Let's see if you can tinkle
when someone's staring at you.

72
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:10,197
Go ahead and take your time.
I have all day.

73
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:11,766
Come on.

74
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:15,183
I've been Mr Barnes' caseworker
for a long time.

75
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,924
He just needs
everyone to cut him some slack.

76
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,840
Here, let me get this door for you.

77
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,795
I mean,
people just don't understand addiction.

78
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,878
Why are we in the on-call room?

79
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,683
Have you ever fooled around in here?

80
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,397
Lots of times.

81
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:39,908
- Never with anyone, but...
- Would you like to change that?

82
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,135
Yes, please.

83
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:53,187
Elliot.

84
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,952
Can you come back in two minutes?

85
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,753
Or 80 minutes?

86
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:02,507
The nurses did a check.
There's 50 Percocet missing.

87
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,900
We should split up into teams
and search every room.

88
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,437
We'll take this one.

89
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,745
Fine.

90
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:15,004
They're gonna go right to Mr Barnes.
I'm gonna check on him.

91
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:19,456
- Alex?
- What?

92
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,880
- I don't like it when you leave.
- Come here.

93
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:29,015
Tonight we'll pick up
right where we left off.

94
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:34,645
20 bucks says it never happens.

95
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,983
What, you're offended?

96
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,616
- Bob, how are you?
- Fine, Allan.

97
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:48,906
Today, I think I'll try a double
half-caf multi-foam latte mochaccino

98
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:52,091
with a shot of vanilla
and a sprinkle of nutmeg.

99
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,813
- Black coffee?
- Bingo-bango.

100
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,137
These people actually like you.

101
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,340
Maybe you should just order.

102
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:05,510
I'll have an espresso, please, and...

103
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,638
What kind of scones do you have?

104
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:14,321
Do you mind, lady? I am in a rush.

105
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,722
My goodness, I'm so sorry.

106
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:22,026
What am I doing, thinking I can take an
extra six seconds to pick my breakfast?

107
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,279
I have to call my mom, tell her
she did a lousy job raising me.

108
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,490
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:32,696
I think what she means is,
she doesn't give a crappuccino.

110
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,229
This is on me.
God help me, I love spunk.

111
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:46,134
How you doing?

112
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:50,494
How are you?
Can I buy you a beer?

113
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:55,242
This is a men's room. There's absolutely
no talking in here. Ever.

114
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,646
It's just so freaky.
We're on the same pee schedule.

115
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,938
No, we're not.

116
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:26,628
<i>This is not good.</i>

117
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:30,443
Why assume Mr Barnes stole it?
There's lots of people on that ward.

118
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,122
Good point.

119
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:35,107
Three of them are in comas,
two can't walk, one's a nun.

120
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:36,911
Also a valid point.

121
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,143
Elliot, I'm sure Mr Barnes
didn't take the drugs.

122
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,320
He has been in rehab
for over six months.

123
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,766
There's no reason to be so judgmental.

124
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:51,312
I am not judgmental. If I were,
I'd tell you your shoes are ugly.

125
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,622
Do not stoop to her level.

126
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,432
Your bangs make you
look like a chipmunk.

127
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:00,227
It's a frame! Why can nobody see that?

128
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:03,021
Can we get back to the matter at hand?

129
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,611
Fine. So who do you think's right?

130
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:06,638
Yeah.

131
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,883
<i>Crap.</i>

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,406
For the love of Oprah,
why would you come to Paediatrics?

133
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:20,527
I can't go unless you're around.
You're my little pee buddy!

134
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,232
What do you say we cut to the chase?

135
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,561
You're dating Carla, the one person
in this hospital I can remotely stand

136
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,188
and she wants us to get all kissy-faced
with each other. I get it. I do.

137
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,258
But every single time
I shake my magic eight ball

138
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:38,772
and ask it
''Are we gonna be best friends?''

139
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,718
- Do you know what it says?
- No.

140
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,079
Outlook is buh-leak.

141
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,537
Dr Cox, you really can't
trust those things.

142
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:49,635
When I was 9, I asked mine if I should
open it and drink the fluid inside.

143
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,361
I puked blue for three days.

144
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:55,839
Just a real cute story.
Here's what you're gonna do.

145
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:59,581
Go back to Carla.
Don't obsess about why she's with you.

146
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,779
Just tell her we went to a ballgame
and we borrowed each other's sweaters.

147
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:08,230
- N-kay, little buddy?
- What a...

148
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:12,014
I don't think we should stand for it.

149
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,836
Dr Kelso can't just decide we're not
allowed to switch shifts any more.

150
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,725
I was supposed to see
my nephew tonight in <i>Pippin.</i>

151
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,277
- Who's he playing?
- Pippin.

152
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:25,103
Bob Kelso is a bad man.

153
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:29,980
I don't know. We never think about
how hard it is to always be the bad guy.

154
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,906
I want him to die.

155
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:35,663
- Hello, sweetness.
- Ladies.

156
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:39,974
Carla, I was thinking about what
you said about your mother's birthday.

157
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:45,070
I don't want her spending it alone,
so I've arranged for you to swap shifts.

158
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:48,118
- Dr Kelso...
- Don't mention it.

159
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:51,364
Should I pick you up tomorrow
at the same place?

160
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,334
Great.
Goodbye, all you smiling faces.

161
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,378
- Who'd you side with? Elliot or Alex?
- Neither. I pretended I was paged.

162
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:09,026
When they said they didn't hear it,
I called them liars and ran.

163
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:12,381
- They both have a point.
- Stick to the booty principle.

164
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:15,320
- What's that?
- Who do you want to sleep with?

165
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,115
- Alex.
- Then she might be right.

166
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:24,488
<i>I'm not sure about Turk's advice.</i>
<i>Sometimes he oversimplifies things.</i>

167
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,968
<i>Especially when it comes to booty.</i>

168
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:31,837
What would you say if I told you
I feel ready right now?

169
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:36,008
I agree with Alex.
I've been thinking about it a lot.

170
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,801
I think she's right about Mr Barnes.
We can't just jump to conclusions.

171
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:43,443
I am so surprised.

172
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:46,066
Tell me something.

173
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,058
- What do you think about Alex?
- No way!

174
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:52,380
I'm saying nothing about a girl
you're sleeping with.

175
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,954
He's not sleeping with her.

176
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,473
No ramifications, nothing.
Tell me what you...

177
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,761
I don't like or trust her.
I'm afraid she's gonna hurt you.

178
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:04,976
- You're jealous.
- Shut up.

179
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:07,789
Shut up because you're so jealous of her

180
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,140
that you don't even care
that I'm happy.

181
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,237
Do you honestly believe
that's what's going on here?

182
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:18,686
<i>Do not under any circumstances</i>
<i>say what you're thinking.</i>

183
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,561
I'm sorry,
but you had your chance with me.

184
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,755
<i>Why don't I ever listen to me?</i>

185
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:40,503
<i>Don't worry about yesterday.</i>

186
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:43,249
<i>Elliot's not the type</i>
<i>that holds a grudge.</i>

187
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,820
<i>Then again...</i>

188
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:53,562
You should tell your neighbour you will
hang your hammock wherever you please,

189
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:56,258
and if she doesn't like it,
she can move.

190
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,366
That's what I like about you, Carla.

191
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,816
You don't give a rat's ass
what anybody thinks.

192
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:06,560
- Morning, Dr Kelso.
- Nurses.

193
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,187
Get up!

194
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:14,428
I want to apologise
for not showing up last night.

195
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,871
I got home and totally passed out.

196
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,492
I wasn't even sure
we had a definite plan, so...

197
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,124
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

198
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:38,721
She seemed sorry. I am too.

199
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:43,221
Someone called for a surgical consult?

200
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,409
You're Dr Turk?

201
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:47,782
Of course you are. Note to self.

202
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:51,674
You've got to start writing down
the names of people that annoy you.

203
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,646
Yeah. What's up?

204
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:58,635
Two-vessel disease.
He hasn't been on medical management...

205
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:01,690
<i>When an attending calls</i>
<i>a lowly intern for a consult,</i>

206
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:05,604
<i>it's an unwritten law the intern</i>
<i>should agree with whatever he says.</i>

207
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,894
Don't you agree?

208
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:12,027
Actually, sir,
I recommend bypass surgery.

209
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,310
That's my pager.

210
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,210
You're wrong.

211
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,360
He's so wrong.

212
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,450
You make me so angry, I...

213
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,284
I have to pee.

214
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:30,238
Me, too.

215
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,791
<i>Look at her.</i>
<i>She's not even gonna say hi to me.</i>

216
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:37,367
<i>Fine, I won't say hi to her. Ever.</i>

217
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:40,431
<i>I can't believe how stubborn she is.</i>

218
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:43,520
<i>I am the wrong man to play chicken with.</i>

219
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:46,801
<i>She'll blink... any second now.</i>

220
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,834
She is so stubborn.

221
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,181
Laverne, could you hand me some gauze?

222
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:57,959
Maybe Dr Kelso can pick you up
and take you to the gauze store.

223
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:00,120
- All right now, listen.
- Carla.

224
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:05,407
This paperwork has your signature on it
and it is totally sub-par.

225
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,463
I won't stand
for this kind of shoddy work.

226
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,665
Let me help you.

227
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:24,178
You went and got an intern to agree
with you so the guy doesn't get surgery?

228
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:28,349
- You caught me.
- A bypass is the right call.

229
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,086
Considering the risks...

230
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,543
He's a diabetic
with two-vessel disease...

231
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:35,455
Antianginals
could be equally effective.

232
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,965
- Either treatment could work?
- Sure.

233
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,991
So what are we arguing about?

234
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,159
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, sweetie.

235
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,801
<i>It was just then they realised</i>
<i>what was really going on.</i>

236
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:51,964
<i>Dr Cox was in love</i>
<i>with Turk's girlfriend.</i>

237
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:54,523
- Either of you want a sandwich?
- I'm all set.

238
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:03,123
So, every tox screening came back
negative on Mr Barnes.

239
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,103
- He didn't take anything.
- So?

240
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:08,188
So, you were wrong.

241
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:12,030
It's not about that any more, is it?

242
00:16:12,276 --> 00:16:15,586
<i>When you can't make things right</i>
<i>with one of your best friends,</i>

243
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,812
<i>nothing can make you feel better.</i>

244
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,585
I'm finally off.
Do you wanna get outta here?

245
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:24,734
Hello?

246
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,828
So, are we doing this or what?

247
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,817
Dr Kelso.

248
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:34,636
- Yes, what is it?
- I wanted to thank you.

249
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:36,952
For what you did.

250
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:40,012
When you yelled at me
in front of the other nurses.

251
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,450
- I appreciate it.
- Young lady,

252
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,994
I yelled at you because that paperwork

253
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:48,494
looked like it had been done
by a drunk four-year-old.

254
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:51,801
Listen, Carla,
I have a family who loves me,

255
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,415
a handful of close friends and
a wonderful hobby shop in my basement.

256
00:16:56,695 --> 00:17:00,483
I don't spend much time worrying
about people's feelings around here.

257
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,096
I just do whatever makes me happy.

258
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:08,324
So...
can I still get a ride tomorrow?

259
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:11,892
I don't know
if I've forgiven you yet for hiding.

260
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,773
But you could always skip
the bus tomorrow morning

261
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:20,078
and take your chances.

262
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:28,458
We're both men.
One of us more than the other.

263
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:30,915
- But that's OK.
- What do you want?

264
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:34,016
I'm not gonna do anything
to mess up you and Carla.

265
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:37,430
I won't tell her how you feel.
It's not my place.

266
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,565
But the minute you screw this thing up,

267
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:44,933
and you will screw it up,
I'll be waiting.

268
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:48,274
If you're gonna wait,
I'd bring a book,

269
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:50,613
cos it's gonna be a while.

270
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,703
- You going in?
- I'm right behind you.

271
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:04,908
Remember when the new <i>Star Wars</i>
movie came out and it was built up,

272
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,455
but it really wasn't that great in bed?

273
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:10,030
Relax. The first one's a freebie,

274
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,377
so you can get your form back.

275
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm gonna change.

276
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:31,283
I already brushed eight times but I'm
gonna take some mints out of your purse.

277
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,933
See, all I did was lose the pants,

278
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,043
but I think it gives me
a completely different look.

279
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,135
- These are Percocet.
- JD.

280
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:49,460
You never came over last night
cos you passed out.

281
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:53,073
Yep, I should go.

282
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:58,579
<i>The speech sounds the same</i>
<i>no matter whose mouth it comes out of.</i>

283
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,331
<i>Even someone you thought</i>
<i>you could really like.</i>

284
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,519
You don't understand, OK?

285
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:06,575
My job comes with a lot of stress.

286
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:09,377
It's not like I have a serious problem.

287
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,334
<i>We ended up talking</i>
<i>for a while after that.</i>

288
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:19,710
<i>I gave her some names</i>
<i>of people that could help her.</i>

289
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,416
<i>But she never got back to me.</i>

290
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,024
<i>After that, things got back to normal.</i>

291
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:36,716
- You owe me 20 bucks.
- No, but I never even made...

292
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:38,975
20 bucks.

293
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:21,984
All right, I should've done this
a long time ago, so here goes.

294
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:28,184
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
accused you of being jealous.

295
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,161
You were just looking out for me.
You were right about Alex.

296
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,641
You never did sleep with her, did you?

297
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,266
Nah. But why does that matter?

298
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,935
Because I was jealous.

299
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,074
Are you sure?

300
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:24,561
What are you thinking about?

301
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:25,904
This.
