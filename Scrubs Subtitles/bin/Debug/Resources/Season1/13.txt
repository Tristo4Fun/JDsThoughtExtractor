1
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:04,971
<i>You asked out a girl</i>
<i>stuck in an MRI machine,</i>

2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:07,178
<i>without ever seeing her face.</i>

3
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:09,506
<i>Remember, no matter</i>
<i>what she looks like,</i>

4
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:11,647
<i>be sure to play it cool.</i>

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,784
Yes!

6
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:17,336
Yes! You are smokin' hot!

7
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,524
In your face!

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,759
<i>That night, we went out</i>
<i>on our first date.</i>

9
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,739
<i>Had our first dinner.</i>

10
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:31,122
<i>Rented our first movie.</i>

11
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:35,373
<i>Took our first long drive.</i>

12
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,587
Look out!

13
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>Killed our first raccoon.</i>

14
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:44,609
<i>Ever since then, every date we've</i>
<i>been on has always ended the same way.</i>

15
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,956
No!

16
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:53,497
Cox wants me back at the hospital.

17
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:57,209
- But the page is addressed to Lillian.
- That's me.

18
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,283
<i>What a drag.</i>

19
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:09,790
<i>That was probably the wrong time</i>
<i>to ask for a quickie.</i>

20
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,418
I have been coerced

21
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,037
by the forces of evil into
conducting rounds this morning.

22
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,387
Why do you have to do rounds?

23
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,920
Because I'm sleepy. How's that?

24
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,748
To make this a more
palatable experience for <i>moi,</i>

25
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:40,699
I am not going to call you by
your names. I'll be referring to you

26
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:44,658
by whatever distinguishing physical
characteristic occurs to me.

27
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:47,107
You, Chicken Beak.

28
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,520
What causes pneumonia
presenting with diarrhoea?

29
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:52,469
- Legionella.
- Nice job.

30
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:56,177
It turns out your mind's
just as sharp as your nose.

31
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:58,459
And you, Dye Job.

32
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:01,068
What are the elements
of Whipple's triad?

33
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:08,337
<i>It's hard to describe how scary</i>
<i>it is when you don't know an answer.</i>

34
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,264
I can't remember. I am so sorry.

35
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,600
What are you sorry about?

36
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,053
Dr Kelso yells at us
when we don't know...

37
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,592
Children,

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,937
you can't let that bloated bag
of hate affect you.

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,676
Being a doctor is as much about
finding the answers as knowing them.

40
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:33,108
For instance, take Clarabelle's
patient here, Mr Yeager.

41
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:35,530
We have no idea what's wrong with him.

42
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:41,867
So we have run tests for everything
and according to these results...

43
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,450
Everything seems
to have come back negative.

44
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:49,560
Which doesn't necessarily mean
that Clarabelle is a failure.

45
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,722
It just means
that she's got to keep trying,

46
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,691
no matter how frustrated she might get.

47
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,096
Now, of course, if you
are lazy and incompetent,

48
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,232
then, yes, that will buy you
a one-way ticket out of here.

49
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,162
Doug.

50
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:09,716
Listen carefully. Kelso can't do a thing
to you if you answer a question wrong.

51
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:14,593
It doesn't work that way. Moving on.
Not you. You still have work to do.

52
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:18,665
Johnny No-Tan? I'd like you to
present the next patient to me.

53
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,957
I love you.

54
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,773
Now say it in Spanish.

55
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,646
<i>Te amo.</i>

56
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,399
Now... say it like Astro.

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,591
I ruv roo.

58
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,818
- You are very, very cute.
- I know.

59
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,979
I've been thinking
about this ''I love you'' thing.

60
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,869
It's gonna make
everything so much better.

61
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:48,622
I mean, we're so in sync.
Better conversation,

62
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:51,099
better dancing...

63
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,052
And?

64
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,199
Way better shrumpdown.

65
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,881
Yeah!

66
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:19,961
I'm so sorry. That has never
happened to me before.

67
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:25,712
<i>Man, she's beautiful.</i>

68
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:29,376
<i>I wish I was that piece of bacon.</i>
<i>Wait a second.</i>

69
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,097
<i>I am that piece of bacon.</i>

70
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,963
That's right.

71
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:36,478
You mind not staring at me
while I'm eating?

72
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,221
I hate it.

73
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,686
- But I'm not.
- What am I doing right now?

74
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,915
- Eating.
- What are you doing?

75
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,160
Staring.

76
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:52,986
There. Now no one gets to eat it.

77
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,902
- You happy?
- Not really.

78
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,596
You know what's great?

79
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,975
Even when our dates get interrupted,
we can have a date here.

80
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:10,837
Let's say
you wanted to watch a movie.

81
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:14,709
We could go to the conference room
and watch that video on STDs.

82
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,344
It's funny and it makes you think.

83
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,136
Maybe it would be good
if we actually had a date that

84
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:24,688
- ends.
- How does a date with you end?

85
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,118
It can range from a kiss at the door

86
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:31,010
to ''all I have for breakfast
is yoghurt and I'm out of bowls,

87
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,096
so you'll have to eat off my stomach.''

88
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,742
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.

89
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,369
It's a date.

90
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,789
Judging from the ataxia dysarthria,

91
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:49,899
I've concluded that Mr Yeager
is suffering from... kuru.

92
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,829
- Kuru?
- Kuru.

93
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,710
- Kuru?
- Yes, kuru.

94
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:56,781
- I'd actually never thought of that.
- Hell, yeah.

95
00:05:56,997 --> 00:06:00,148
Were you aware that the only
documented cases of kuru

96
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,412
were members of a cannibalistic tribe
in Papua New Guinea?

97
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,143
- I was not.
- Actually, doc,

98
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,296
I was in New Guinea last week.

99
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,901
- Really?
- No.

100
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:15,406
- Do you happen to know what a zebra is?
- He just mocked me.

101
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,674
It's a diagnosis of an obscure disease

102
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:24,014
when it's more likely to be a common
illness with uncommon symptoms.

103
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:27,308
In other words,
if you hear hoof beats,

104
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:31,521
you just go ahead
and think horsies, not zebras.

105
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,852
Mm-kay, Mr Silly Bear?

106
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,948
- What's wrong?
- It's personal.

107
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:44,594
Why won't you ever open up to me?
I came to you

108
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,947
when I thought I had a broken tailbone
and it was just a really bad pimple.

109
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:51,207
It's a sex thing. OK?

110
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:57,494
Like a gender issue or like intercourse?
Because I'm book-smart on both.

111
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:02,195
Carla? Use me.

112
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:09,138
- Last night, when I was with Carla...
- Dude, I can't talk.

113
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,829
I gotta figure this Mr Yeager thing out.

114
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,463
Cool.

115
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,066
My horse didn't finish the race.

116
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:20,202
I'm at the filling station,
but my credit card's declined.

117
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,291
- I'm on the jet ski...
- I got it!

118
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,292
- Good. I had no idea what to say...
- No. Mr Yeager.

119
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:30,379
Where you go...?
Who am I going to talk to about sex?

120
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,463
Let's get our talk on.

121
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,877
Player to player.

122
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,547
<i>Afternoon rounds</i>
<i>that day began like any other.</i>

123
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:44,602
This patient is hypoglycaemic. What
are the signs of an insulinoma, Dr Reid?

124
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,489
Elevated C-peptide levels.

125
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:50,163
Score! But before you do
your crazy end-zone dance,

126
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:53,678
tell me the spinal fluid findings
in Guillaume-Barré syndrome.

127
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,374
- Xanthochromia?
- Wrong!

128
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:00,887
<i>And then it happened. Suddenly,</i>
<i>Dr Kelso didn't seem as frightening.</i>

129
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:04,838
Dr Reid, what do you
have to say for yourself?

130
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,039
Win some, lose some.

131
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,920
<i>In fact, nothing he did</i>
<i>seemed to scare us.</i>

132
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,147
<i>Not any more.</i>

133
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:21,085
<i>Not even the most horrible thing</i>
<i>he could think of.</i>

134
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:28,293
All right, welcome to the ICU!
No, really, sit down.

135
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:32,233
For women that don't know how to cook.
I put the Yellow Pages in there.

136
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:36,604
What do you want? Mexican? Italian?
Japanese? American cuisine?

137
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:40,016
It's a cook...
I'm flat-linin'. Beep!

138
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,220
Save him!

139
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,328
Tip your nurses.

140
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,841
<i>And I think he knew</i>
<i>who was behind it.</i>

141
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:55,148
Cox.

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,228
<i>Talk to me</i>

143
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,550
You know,
that's really getting annoying.

144
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,728
Every time you say it, it makes me
not want to talk to you all the more.

145
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,067
<i>Talk to me</i>

146
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,190
All right, fine!

147
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,536
Last night, Turk and I were,
you know, messin' around.

148
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:30,260
- It's really hot, like always.
- Hot like how? Describe it.

149
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:32,455
Dude!

150
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,702
So suddenly, things aren't happening.
You know what I mean?

151
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,846
The only change is that we said
''I love you'' to each other.

152
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,449
It's true.

153
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:46,716
I have never said ''I love you''
to a woman before.

154
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,093
Then how do you
get them to sleep with you?

155
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:53,423
It's three little words.
It shouldn't have this effect, right?

156
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:58,971
Anyway, I told him it wasn't his fault.
These things happen occasionally.

157
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,272
Try constantly.

158
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,806
I have cold hands, and...

159
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,459
So when I saw you this morning
and I said ''How's your penis?''

160
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,984
and you didn't wanna talk about it...

161
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:17,477
Dude. It's not me.

162
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,665
It's me.

163
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:22,994
Last night, for the first time
ever in our relationship,

164
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,053
no matter how long we tried,

165
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,658
I was unable to have an...

166
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:39,898
Dr Cox, I got the sed rate back
on Mr Yeager. Say ''how do'' to that.

167
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,510
But then
I'm due back at the hootenanny.

168
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,408
I noticed he had a rash. I realised
he's been having jaw claudication,

169
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:49,130
- which led me to...
- Temporal arteritis.

170
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:54,246
Of course. Nurse, start Mr Yeager on
solumedrol and get the surgery resident?

171
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,820
He needs a temporal
artery biopsy stat.

172
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:59,200
Newbie, I can handle this.

173
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:01,613
- You're off, aren't you?
- I'm with you.

174
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:04,475
Fair enough.
Let's go treat the patient.

175
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,070
<i>I am so on top of things tonight,</i>
<i>it's scary.</i>

176
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,851
Hell, yeah.

177
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,156
<i>You're only 80 minutes late.</i>
<i>She'll still be here.</i>

178
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,036
<i>Please be here. Come on, Alex.</i>

179
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,872
<i>Please be here.</i>

180
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,566
You gotta be kidding me.

181
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:34,216
There's a waste of a gift certificate.

182
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,435
Cancel the cobbler!

183
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,772
She's not having an orgasm.

184
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,522
Still not seeing what the problem is.

185
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,699
I've never even had an orgasm.

186
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:57,278
I'm sorry.
I should be more surprised.

187
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,394
That'd be nice.

188
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:05,571
- I want to talk to you about rounds.
- Here we go. Bring it on.

189
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,213
They're all yours.

190
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,686
You will be leading them from now on.

191
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:15,262
You've stunned me, but you
haven't dropped me to the mat.

192
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,096
Waiting for the roundhouse here.
The old haymaker,

193
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,250
when the yelling starts
and the voice gets high-pitched.

194
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,299
''Daddy, I've been bad.
Daddy, I've been a bad boy.''

195
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,981
''Oh, Daddy!
Daddy, I've been bad.''

196
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,904
If you're not gonna play, it's no fun.

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,638
Hey, Alex, I am so sorry. I went
to the restaurant but just missed you.

198
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,049
Then I called, but there was no answer,

199
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:45,148
then I stopped by, and I guess
you didn't see me which was odd,

200
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:49,683
cos I was standing next to
the pizza guy while you were paying him.

201
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,925
We're still cool, right?

202
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,102
- Look, JD...
- ''Look, JD, we're still great?''

203
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:04,182
I think you're a really good guy.
OK? But...

204
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:07,575
- Alex dumped me.
- The blind girl you've been dating?

205
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,794
- She's not blind.
- Of course not.

206
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,770
How'd you drop the ball?
Don't tell me you cried,

207
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,205
or I'll ban you
from the men's room again.

208
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,785
I was so excited what we were
doing here, I forgot about our date.

209
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,814
<i>You didn't forget. You kept looking</i>
<i>at your watch. I saw you.</i>

210
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:29,628
I assumed that you were
afraid of missing <i>Judging Amy.</i>

211
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:32,381
It never occurred to me
you were choosing work

212
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,093
over being with
that sweet little biscuit.

213
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:38,242
That means a lot coming from you,

214
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,409
Mr Right-here-with-me
two-hours-after-his-shift-

215
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:44,859
and-last-Monday-night-too... guy.

216
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,479
- What?
- You heard me.

217
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:50,315
Newbie, what're you saying?

218
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,946
That you want to be like me?

219
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,059
Do you understand that
I just barely want to be like me?

220
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:11,886
I can't even pretend
I can give you tips on intercourse.

221
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,631
I got one for you.
Stop calling it that.

222
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:18,707
My therapist thinks my trouble in bed
stems from a fear of intimacy,

223
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:23,109
but I think it's because any type
of repetitive motion makes me nauseous.

224
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:27,576
And since I was a kid,
I've had nightmares about being crushed.

225
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,991
That poor shrink.

226
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:34,409
The one thing I do know is that
I've sabotaged a lot of relationships

227
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:38,390
by never talking things out
with the guy that I'm seeing.

228
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,318
- Thanks.
- Sure.

229
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:48,529
So...
You've really never had...

230
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,656
No.

231
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,213
- Not even by yourself?
- Gross.

232
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,888
Is it easy?

233
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,068
When's your next laundry night?

234
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,003
Ted.

235
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,002
I need you to take care
of some lawyer crap for me.

236
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:13,369
It'd be great if you would go to traffic
court for me and make this go away.

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,598
I don't think so.

238
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,427
Excuse me?

239
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:24,755
No, Bob! I have my own things
I need to take care of.

240
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:27,704
Of course.

241
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,262
Walk off, bitch.

242
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,326
How is it, exactly,
that you just said that

243
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,843
and your pants are still dry?

244
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,425
Don't you understand

245
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:43,659
what you did
when you spoke to those interns?

246
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,232
You took away the fear.

247
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:51,297
You...
are a wonderful person,

248
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,357
and... I love you.

249
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:06,182
<i>I have to ask Alex</i>
<i>for another chance. I have to.</i>

250
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,558
<i>OK, she's with a hot guy. Stay calm.</i>
<i>She's gonna be psyched to see you.</i>

251
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,049
JD. Hey.

252
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,591
<i>Or not.</i>

253
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,619
I don't prioritise you over my job,
but I'd like to.

254
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:21,064
I wanted to be a doctor for so long,

255
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,885
I sort of forgot
how to want anything else.

256
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,391
And now I meet you, and...

257
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,968
I'll do anything in the world
if you give me a second chance.

258
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:34,426
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,133
I'll leave you guys alone.

260
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,426
OK, Rowdy,

261
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,674
fetch!

262
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,767
Hey, sweetie?

263
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,297
- We have to talk.
- No time for talk.

264
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,920
We have a problem
we need to take care of.

265
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,582
Why are you wearing
a nose-breathing thingy?

266
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,219
Baby, bear with me.
I got big ideas.

267
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,961
I've been having all these
thoughts going through my head,

268
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,642
and I'm afraid if I tell you,
I'd scare you away.

269
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:13,864
That's the last thing that I wanna...
Take that damn thing off.

270
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:16,767
Oh, God.

271
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:22,657
Baby, there's nothing
that could scare me away.

272
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:29,489
Since we said ''I love you'',
I've been feeling all this pressure.

273
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:32,291
And wondering about the future.
Our future.

274
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,157
Are we gonna get married?
Are we gonna have kids?

275
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,637
If so, when will I get my figure back?

276
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,896
Where are we gonna live? Will my mother
live with us? How big a house?

277
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,470
How many bathrooms?
What if she walks in on you

278
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:49,373
while you're in the bathroom, you fall,
and I can't afford the funeral costs?

279
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,705
That's a little scary.

280
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,311
I guess I just need to know
you think about that stuff too.

281
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,108
Carla?

282
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,773
No, I don't.

283
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,051
- But I love it that you do.
- Yeah?

284
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,910
That's what
makes this relationship work.

285
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,905
We're so different.
I keep us in the present,

286
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,863
you look out for what's up ahead.

287
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,497
Besides, there is no way in hell

288
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,216
your mother's ever
going to live with us.

289
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,291
If she ever walks in on me
while I'm in the bathroom,

290
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,775
she's getting a trip to Florida.

291
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,951
- No, she's not.
- I'm tell...

292
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,651
Ladies and germs,
if you get this shorthand down,

293
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,399
it has a way of making your day
go quicker.

294
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:45,872
''CTD'' being ''circling the drain.''
Your patient is on the way out.

295
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,013
''SOB'', ''shortness of breath''
and ''WNL'', ''within normal limits''.

296
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,261
Elvis, feel free to write this down,

297
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:55,670
any time before
you leave the building.

298
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,574
- You paged me?
- I didn't page you.

299
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:03,170
<i>And that's when Dr Cox started</i>
<i>poking the old bear with a stick.</i>

300
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,486
I'm sick
of the grill 'em and drill 'em.

301
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,095
What do you say
we shake things up?

302
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:13,237
You kids ask me the questions,
and I'll just give you the answers.

303
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:16,536
Dr Cox, could I talk to you?

304
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,067
Sure, Bob, but you have to raise
your hand like all the other children.

305
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:24,574
- I just think it's inappropriate...
- Bob-o?

306
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,273
Now, you've got five
good ones right there.

307
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:32,184
What do you say you put 'em up
in the air like you just don't care?

308
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,595
Get over here, right now.

309
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,812
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and</i>
<i>didn't wanna take the one thing he had.</i>

310
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:42,186
<i>Maybe he just hated rounds.</i>

311
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,397
Get the hell outta my ICU!

312
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:47,009
<i>But if you didn't</i>
<i>know Dr Cox like I did,</i>

313
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:50,512
<i>you would've believed</i>
<i>his performance too.</i>

314
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:54,183
<i>I guess the key</i>
<i>to a lot of things is balance.</i>

315
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,773
<i>Whether it's balance of power...</i>

316
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,219
Dr Simotas, stop smiling.

317
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,054
I hate smiling.

318
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,549
<i>...balance in love...</i>

319
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,492
<i>...or sometimes...</i>

320
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,415
<i>...just balance.</i>

321
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,707
<i>For some of us,</i>
<i>it seems too far out of reach.</i>

322
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,721
<i>Too difficult to achieve.</i>

323
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,193
<i>But the important thing</i>
<i>is just to never stop trying.</i>

324
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:25,585
<i>Especially if you</i>
<i>like girls named Alex.</i>

325
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,996
<i>And chicken salad.</i>
