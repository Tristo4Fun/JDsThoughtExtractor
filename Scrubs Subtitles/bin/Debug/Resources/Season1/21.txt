1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,036
Do you know what
I want to do to you tonight?

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,821
- You didn't say anything.
- I know.

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,525
It was gonna be kinky,
and I got embarrassed.

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:16,237
Really kinky?
Was I a bad girl?

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,706
Very bad. You had to go
to the principal's office.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,732
I have an early shift tomorrow.

7
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,378
- I've got to sleep.
- Want me to take you home?

8
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,962
No. But if we're gonna pick up
a schoolgirl outfit and have sex,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,191
we have to leave this minute.

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,044
<i>One of the best things about</i>
<i>women is they're unpredictable.</i>

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,360
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that can bite you in the ass.</i>

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,102
Boink.
Who's your new friend?

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:47,173
Look, it got a letter.

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,418
So I put on a few pounds.

15
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,592
But how would you like it
if somebody did this to you?

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,715
I wouldn't.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,404
- I don't think it's fair.
- It isn't fair.

18
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,240
- Now, eat your doughnut.
- Eat your doughnut.

19
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,747
<i>And I was having problems</i>
<i>with my lady too.</i>

20
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,817
Get a move on. I got tickets to
<i>Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk.</i>

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,501
We're gonna take blood so we can check

22
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,088
your hepatitis viral load.
Absolutely no big deal.

23
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,141
<i>No big deal at all.</i>

24
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,685
Could somebody get that?

25
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,077
These tests
are gonna come back negative.

26
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,789
Everybody who works
in a hospital eventually gets stuck.

27
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,780
Thanks for being so nice to me.

28
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,461
Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?

29
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:59,446
I understand you might need
a refresher course in hospital safety.

30
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,377
This is a syringe.
When filled with infected blood,

31
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,096
where is the last place
you might want to stick it?

32
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,645
- In my arm.
- Very good, Dr Dorian.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,917
Mr Sarcastic strikes again.

34
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,206
For God's sake, sir, just fire me.

35
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,227
Just get him to sign the damn paper.

36
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,044
What's this?

37
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,496
If you develop any symptoms that suggest
you may have contracted hepatitis B,

38
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,082
this form states
the hospital is not responsible.

39
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,036
Thanks. That's comforting.

40
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,273
I'm sure you'll be fine.

41
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:36,767
Here's your pen.

42
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,003
Keep it.

43
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,993
Is he gonna make it?

44
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,481
- Doesn't look good.
- Yay!

45
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,851
Isn't that what you were wearing
when you left last night?

46
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,092
<i>The walk of shame.</i>

47
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,104
<i>All you can hope for is a supportive</i>
<i>friend to help you get through it.</i>

48
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,248
<i>Elliot got some booty</i>

49
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,453
Stop it.

50
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,210
What? It's my
''Elliot got some booty'' dance.

51
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:28,501
Elliot,
it's not like anybody else knows.

52
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,744
- What's up, porn star?
- Somebody toasted that marshmallow.

53
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,266
Well?

54
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,433
<i>Somebody got some action</i>

55
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,055
Come on. It's funny.

56
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:48,696
I can't find my scrubs top.
I must've left it at Sean's.

57
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,054
<i>The curse of the scrubs machine.</i>

58
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,746
<i>One of the hospital's</i>
<i>annoying money savers.</i>

59
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:57,333
<i>The only way to get clean scrubs out</i>
<i>is to put dirty ones in.</i>

60
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,766
- How can I help?
- Give me your shirt.

61
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,338
- How else can I help?
- Just go.

62
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,144
Good morning, sir.

63
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,617
And yet another
proud day for Dr Reid.

64
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:24,474
I'd say it can only get better,
but we both know that isn't true.

65
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,919
Right, sweetheart?

66
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,456
Yeah.

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,936
You know I'm crazy in love with you.

68
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,144
Don't tell me you're obsessing
over a joke I made.

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,510
- I'm not obsessing.
- Good.

70
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,846
Careful. I just might eat you.

71
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,945
I see it all the time: The long hours,
the stress eating, no exercise.

72
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,591
There's not a doctor here
who's in shape.

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,576
Nothing better than a good sweat.

74
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,351
Turk! It was a joke!

75
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,754
Alrighty.

76
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,756
What do we have here?

77
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,602
What you've got here are four cases
of Legionnaires' pneumonia.

78
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,408
So I would start us out
on IV aminoglycosides.

79
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,195
Check for urinary legionella antigen.

80
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,070
It could be viral, considering
my gastrointestinal situation.

81
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,068
Here comes the fart joke.

82
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,509
I think I may have strep pneumo.

83
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,768
- All four of us are doctors.
- Let me guess. Golf cart accident?

84
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,496
- Playing.
- Medical convention.

85
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,980
So, what's with
the antecubital venipuncture?

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,042
I got hit with
of one of my hep B patients' syringes.

87
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,651
I once had a colleague
who got bit by a patient with rabies.

88
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,191
- He's OK, right?
- No, he died.

89
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,819
A friend from med school
contracted leprosy.

90
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,004
They amputated one of his toes.
Popped it right off.

91
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:50,658
But hepatitis. Scary stuff.

92
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,400
- I'll be OK.
- Maybe.

93
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:58,276
I have to go check on a thing...

94
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,445
To interns.

95
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,845
- We cannot have intercourse tonight.
- Stop calling it that.

96
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,076
I'm falling so behind
on my reading, and I really...

97
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,809
Don't always assume
I wanna be fooling around.

98
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,079
Sometimes I'm happy just
thinking about fooling around.

99
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,373
Why can't couples just be together?

100
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,474
- Why is it always about sex?
- Yes, Sean.

101
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:35,916
Freud said 90% of all human behaviour
is motivated by sexual impulses.

102
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,063
30% of my behaviour
is motivated by advertising,

103
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,311
and the rest by violence in film.

104
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,194
For me it's 98% getting my dad
to love me, 2% chocolate.

105
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:52,262
Now, you have to stop talking to me
so I can get some work done.

106
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,604
Say it.

107
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,787
Intercourse.

108
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,992
Way to get your burger on.

109
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,532
Just exactly what in the hell is this?

110
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,759
I need to talk to you.

111
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:20,805
Dr Cox, I haven't had a chance
to tell you this yet. Your name rocks!

112
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,857
Come on!

113
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,107
This conversation stops
until cabana boy here goes.

114
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,200
- He's not the boss of me.
- Todd.

115
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,322
Cool.

116
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,581
So how do you do it?
How do you stay in shape?

117
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,509
Discipline.
Some of us work on our appearance.

118
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,781
Could I work out with you some time?

119
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,438
I don't know about that.

120
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,704
I'm not particularly fond of you,
although

121
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,397
it might be fun to see you
flail about for a couple of days.

122
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,028
You know what?
Forget about it.

123
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,693
You see that guy there?

124
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,964
That's you in five years.

125
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,995
You in ten years.

126
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,141
And guess what, He-Man?

127
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,275
You in 20.

128
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,058
I'm in.

129
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,691
<i>I won't let those doctors scare me.</i>
<i>I always get right back on the horse.</i>

130
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:23,395
I'm so sorry you're alone, Mr Winston,
but meningococcus is highly contagious.

131
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,107
- I don't have anyone to talk to.
- Good news, friend.

132
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,060
The doctor is in.

133
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:34,937
I asked for a newspaper, and they gave
me Judy Blume books from Paediatrics.

134
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,897
I don't know anything about those.

135
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,332
Read <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.</i>

136
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,160
Completely turned
high school around for me.

137
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,506
<i>You see? Nobody keeps</i>
<i>John Dorian from moving on.</i>

138
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:49,728
<i>Nobody.</i>

139
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,510
We've replaced this doctor's blood
with hepatitis blood.

140
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,576
Let's see if he notices.

141
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:01,626
I could be really sick here.
Could you be nice for once?

142
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,254
How's that?

143
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:09,539
I have not been this happy
since, well, ever.

144
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,360
Don't you think Sean and I
are a great couple?

145
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,670
I don't know Sean,
and you've never spoken to me before.

146
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,120
We just click on every level.

147
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,142
- God, and the sex.
- My name is Vijay.

148
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:25,825
Let's see who's on their game and start
off with a case of pheochromocytoma.

149
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,303
What is the initial test, Dr Reid?

150
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,397
24-hour urinary metanephrines?

151
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,529
Right-o. And what is your
preoperative treatment?

152
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,459
- ACE inhibitors?
- Wrong-o.

153
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:39,213
Why don't you attempt to crawl out
of your shame hole,

154
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,812
and tell me the aetiology
of hypocalcaemia in sarcoidosis.

155
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,054
Gutter ball!

156
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,684
Yesterday you were
running around my hospital half-naked.

157
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,884
- Yeah, baby.
- Today you're mucking up my rounds.

158
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,814
Is your ponytail too tight?

159
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,691
Perhaps you have a case
of the boogie-woogie flu?

160
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:05,285
Something is different,
because you are slipping.

161
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,597
Next patient.

162
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:15,351
The key to my exercise programme is
this one simple truth: I hate my body.

163
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,057
What?

164
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,669
The second you look in the mirror

165
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,260
and you're happy with what you see,
you just lost the battle.

166
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,457
You should give speeches
to teenage girls.

167
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,298
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Did you bring his leash?

168
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,381
- What are you doing?
- Going for a run with Dr Cox.

169
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,504
But we were supposed to go to the park.

170
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,235
I was gonna let you
tell me how pretty I am.

171
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,627
- See ya, chubby!
- Son of a...

172
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,323
Baby, you're prettier every day.

173
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,627
I'm prettier in the park.

174
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,544
<i>I don't know what it is,</i>
<i>but I'm noticing something.</i>

175
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,977
<i>In this hospital,</i>
<i>there are sick people everywhere.</i>

176
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,775
I'm OK.

177
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:35,492
You're a jumpy little fellow. Your blood
tests are negative, so you're fine.

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,978
I think I speak for the entire
administration when I say ''whoop-de-do''.

179
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,960
Wrap it up for me, Ned.

180
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,236
- It's Ted.
- I know.

181
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:49,244
I know a guy who can
take care of him for us.

182
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,745
One phone call.

183
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,640
<i>I knew I didn't have hepatitis.</i>
<i>Why did I make myself crazy?</i>

184
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,088
<i>John Dorian is stronger than that.</i>

185
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,868
<i>I said John Dorian</i>
<i>is stronger than that.</i>

186
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,626
Carla, could you do me a favour and
just give him a follow-up neuro exam?

187
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,181
I'm just so swamped right now.

188
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,359
- Sure, Bambi. No problem.
- Thank you.

189
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,887
<i>John Dorian's a wuss.</i>

190
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:35,495
<i>It wasn't that hard for me</i>
<i>to avoid my contagious guy.</i>

191
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:39,025
Carla, can you check Kernig
and Brudzinski signs on Mr Winston?

192
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,253
- And why can't you do it?
- I would, but I don't got no mojo.

193
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,903
I have to go lecture
some med students

194
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,136
on myocardial infarction.

195
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,464
I saw them waiting for you
in the You're Full of Crap Ward.

196
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,765
You know the way.

197
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,854
What are you doing here?

198
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:04,308
I bought extra scrubs
so you never have to work topless again.

199
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,891
Unless you start dancing,
which I'm OK with.

200
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,080
- Great. So he's thoughtful too.
- Are you mad at me?

201
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,852
The yelling makes it
seem like you're mad.

202
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,273
You would know.

203
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:19,050
You're so thoughtful and handsome,
you wouldn't forget your scrubs.

204
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,499
I don't wear scrubs. One time, I locked
my keys in my car while it was running.

205
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,718
- On a bridge.
- I have to go.

206
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,127
I'll call you later, and you can
explain what just happened.

207
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,995
Don't be embarrassed
about staring at my ass.

208
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:39,025
You're only human,
and everybody does it anyway.

209
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,839
Lonely?

210
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,865
A little.

211
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:51,029
- I'm doing this for someone else.
- What do you say we pick it up?

212
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,599
Let's pick it up.

213
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,909
<i>When someone calls you out,</i>

214
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,840
<i>there's only one thing to do:</i>
<i>Deal with your fear.</i>

215
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,040
Dr Cox, could I get you
to cover Mr Winston?

216
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,888
He's my meningitis patient.
A personality difference.

217
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,606
He says tomato, and I say...

218
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,461
...''to-mah-to.''

219
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:15,038
Sure. I'll take him.
You grab my three gomers in 408.

220
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,582
- What's wrong with them?
- I assume they're sick.

221
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:21,935
I thought about what you said before,
and you're right.

222
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,826
I haven't been that nice.

223
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,059
- And?
- That's it.

224
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:31,111
What, do you want to go to a ballgame
and share a big tub of popcorn?

225
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,200
That's the last time I reach out.

226
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,256
Anybody want to go to a...
Not you.

227
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,435
- Doctors.
- Doctor.

228
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:45,988
I love that.

229
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:49,732
Dr Douglas, I got the results back
from your fasting lipids.

230
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:53,046
Your LLD's very elevated,
so you may want to start a...

231
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,773
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?

232
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,654
- You knew the answer.
- Shut up.

233
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:03,412
- What's your problem?
- This doesn't come easy for me.

234
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,727
I study every night, and you know what
else I do to remember all this crap?

235
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:12,224
I tape record myself saying it,
and I listen to myself over and over.

236
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:18,492
Do you have any idea how annoying it is
to hear myself go on and on and on

237
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,206
and on?

238
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,733
No.

239
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:27,478
Come on. I have problems too.
I traded my meningitis patient.

240
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,230
Traded him like a baseball card.

241
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,740
Wanna know why?
I was afraid of him.

242
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,211
I'm a doctor who's afraid of sick
people. Wanna take a picture with me?

243
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,836
<i>It's a weird feeling when</i>
<i>you realise you've lost the respect</i>

244
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,103
<i>of four people all at once.</i>

245
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:49,689
<i>But it's nothing compared to</i>
<i>losing respect for yourself.</i>

246
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,585
Push it out. Two more.

247
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,864
Come on, kid. Bitchin' reps.

248
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,954
- A dumb-ass says what?
- What?

249
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,128
I said,
''A dumb-ass says what?''

250
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,361
What?

251
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,263
- You're down here again?
- 20!

252
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,268
Hey, baby.

253
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,504
- You likes?
- I miss you.

254
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,604
Maybe tonight we can, you know,
rent a movie and then not watch it.

255
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,493
We just got started down here.

256
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,906
No problem.

257
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,110
Just don't wake me up if you
get home too late, OK?

258
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:38,109
Props for the commitment.

259
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,689
- I'm out.
- And there it is.

260
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,115
I knew your ass would quit.

261
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,857
- I got a life.
- Cry me a river.

262
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,086
My dance card is full-up too.

263
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,536
How many nights a week
are you in here?

264
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,792
- A few.
- He's being modest.

265
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,534
He's down here
polishing his guns every night.

266
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,877
That doesn't mean I don't have a life.

267
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,020
A couple times we went
out for a beer after.

268
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:06,110
- You two have fun.
- Dr Cox.

269
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,196
- Can I get a spot?
- I'm here for you.

270
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,884
Oh, God.

271
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,989
I gotta meet someone.

272
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,594
Big kahuna, little help?

273
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,183
I just came by to apologise.

274
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:29,220
- For what?
- I'm not sure.

275
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,381
But I am really sorry.

276
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,783
I should be the one apologising.
I got so buried in work,

277
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,608
and then I just took it all out on you.

278
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,847
I'm big on forgiving people who look
like they're about to kiss me.

279
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,759
And the work never ends.

280
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,936
I have to be ready for rounds,
take care of my patients,

281
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,590
I have scut work
and research papers due.

282
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:57,776
And if my internship
does not go well this year,

283
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,828
I'm not getting
a good residency next year.

284
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,077
And without the residency,
there goes my fellowship,

285
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,966
and that doesn't leave
a lot of time for us.

286
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:11,244
So I think that maybe
we should make this more casual.

287
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,979
But, come on,
I know I could never be casual with you.

288
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:18,531
We'd just end up here again, right?

289
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,000
What are you saying?

290
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,256
I don't know.

291
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,589
Then why are you saying it?

292
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:29,216
My God.

293
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,035
I think I'm saying that I can't
make this work right now.

294
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,035
I've got an idea. Let's go back to where
you said that you should be apologising.

295
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,887
Then we'll kiss again,
cos that was good.

296
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,358
Sean, you don't understand how hard
it was for me just to get to this point.

297
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,062
If I don't do my best,
I'm going to hate myself for ever.

298
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,412
What's with being the best?

299
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,582
What is so bad about being adequate?
That's what I do.

300
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,997
No, you don't.

301
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,198
I know.

302
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,825
I have to go back in.

303
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:14,967
I'm just gonna stand here
and wait with these flowers

304
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:19,748
cos in two minutes you'll realise
what a big mistake you're making.

305
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,114
I hope so.

306
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,786
- I want my meningitis patient back.
- No.

307
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:38,718
Do you know any women who hate
themselves enough to date me?

308
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,929
- Why'd you let me switch patients?
- You asked me to.

309
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,975
- And because of your puppy-dog eyes.
- You knew I was scared.

310
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,219
Why didn't you tell me to deal with it?

311
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,547
I don't know what it was about that day.

312
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:54,282
Maybe I hadn't had enough sleep,
maybe my mind was on other things.

313
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:59,886
Maybe I didn't have enough fibre,
and failed to do my morning business.

314
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,840
I don't know what it was,
but the bottom line is

315
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,312
I didn't feel like
spelling it out for you.

316
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:09,093
You want your little speech,
and that's fine, because here it is.

317
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,803
You're a doctor. You might get sick.

318
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,403
Get over it.

319
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,856
Thank you.
Now, can I have my patient back?

320
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,647
No. Because, aside from
his weird Judy Blume obsession,

321
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,601
I like him.
You will be delousing Mr Schaffer.

322
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,921
Guy's like flypaper.

323
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:29,457
Fantastic.

324
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,197
And, Belinda,

325
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:33,587
do you know what else
is real contagious?

326
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,926
A big ol' smile!

327
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,775
<i>When you start med school,</i>

328
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,147
<i>they warn you that you're gonna</i>
<i>have to make sacrifices.</i>

329
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,701
<i>That means different things</i>
<i>to different people.</i>

330
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,975
<i>Like giving up something you want now</i>

331
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,891
<i>for something you've wanted</i>
<i>your whole life.</i>

332
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,796
<i>Or spending less time on yourself</i>

333
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:04,804
<i>so you can spend more time</i>
<i>with someone you love.</i>

334
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:16,141
<i>At some point, you might even have to</i>
