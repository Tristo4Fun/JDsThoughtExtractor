1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,788
How's he doing?

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,959
He has neutropenic fever.
His white blood cell count's stabilised.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,734
He's not getting any worse.

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,082
- How you feeling, Jared?
- OK, I guess.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,940
I heard your dad arranged
for a visit from The Rock?

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,376
I'm 13, I must love wrestling, right?

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,723
Come on, The Rock's a movie star.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,496
What could a guy
possibly wanna see more?

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,252
Guys, we need an answer.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,079
Name one thing guys wanna see
more than anything in the world?

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,207
Louie, we're gonna go with boobs.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,213
Show me boobs.

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,333
There they are.

14
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,972
Good job!

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,267
I wanna see 'em on a real girl.
A cute girl.

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,210
You're cute.

17
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,213
<i>The janitor.</i>
<i>This guy is always bothering me.</i>

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,011
<i>Don't look at him,</i>
<i>don't talk to him, don't...</i>

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,031
What's your point?
Ammonia too strong?

20
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,811
- No, I have a...
- That's one.

21
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,642
Keep pushin'.

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,788
Hey, sport. Got your page.

23
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,799
This better be good.
Paging the Chief of Medicine.

24
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,163
<i>Dr Steadman. Resident</i>
<i>and first-class teacher's pet.</i>

25
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,034
Sir, I was going over
Mr Martinez's chart,

26
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:50,744
and it seems the TIPS procedure
he's scheduled for is unnecessary.

27
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,984
Why unnecessary?

28
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,747
He's dead.

29
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,212
Excellent catch, Dr...

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,713
Dr...

31
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,103
<i>Dorian! You see me every day.</i>

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,886
- <i>Say my name. Say it!</i>
- Martinez.

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,281
That was the name
of the patient, sir.

34
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,774
- Avery.
- That's the clipboard manufacturer.

35
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,480
- Fine work, doctor. Fine work.
- <i>I hear that.</i>

36
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,915
Ammonia's a little strong today.

37
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,596
That's two.

38
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,806
Steady, boy.

39
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,615
Now, Rowdy.

40
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,182
- When you're not here, he does it.
- I'm sure. He's shy.

41
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,048
I think you should go ahead
and do it.

42
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,919
- I am not flashing my breasts.
- It's easy.

43
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,116
- You just go like this.
- That's hot.

44
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,166
I went by paediatrics.

45
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,211
- They thought it was funny.
- I'm borrowing a sweatshirt.

46
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,971
What did we agree you would do
whenever I left a room?

47
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,334
- I'm sorry, baby.
- That's better.

48
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,666
My man Turk is getting it daily,
nightly and ever-so-rightly.

49
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,896
What up, dawg!

50
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,066
<i>Once every 4.2 seconds,</i>
<i>a man says something stupid</i>

51
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,404
<i>that a woman hears and punishes him for.</i>
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,024
What did you just say?

53
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,848
What up, dawg?

54
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,393
Why would you think we'd slept together?

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,785
Because I'm a nurse?
Because I'm Latina?

56
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,640
Because you guys
have been dating for a while.

57
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:44,043
Do Latina women put out more?
That's not something I've heard.

58
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,664
- Turk told me.
- No! I didn't! He assumed.

59
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,886
And did you correct him?

60
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,294
I've been really busy
at the hospital lately.

61
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,050
Is that how you see this relationship?
As some mad dash to the finish line?

62
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,837
I'll take you into that bedroom now

63
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,231
and you will be walking sideways
for the rest of your life,

64
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,811
because I will have used all your up
and down. Now, is that what you want?

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,755
- No.
- Good.

66
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,753
Because what I want is for this
to be a real relationship.

67
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,203
I want us to know each other
better than we know ourselves.

68
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,065
- Wow.
- That's right, ''wow''.

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,619
So if you really want me ''daily and
nightly and ever-so-rightly'',...

70
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,928
That sounds like
something you'd say.

71
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,377
...show me you know me.

72
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,697
I think you should
let the kid meet the ladies.

73
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,690
You're the one who told
Kelso that Mr Martinez was dead?

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,782
- That's terrific work.
- <i>Looks like word gets around.</i>

75
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,392
What in the name of <i>Are You There, God?</i>
<i>It's Me, Margaret</i> were you thinking?

76
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:55,103
I'm certain invasive vascular procedures
have a low success rate on dead people.

77
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,618
That TIPS procedure
was for Mrs Blitt down in 103.

78
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,317
You see, she doesn't have insurance.

79
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,184
But Mr Martinez had great insurance.

80
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,665
Should I talk slower or get a nurse
who speaks fluent Moron?

81
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:13,761
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- What do you want from me?

82
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,950
I don't know if they taught you this
in the land of puppy-dog tails

83
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,087
where you obviously, if not grew up,
then spent most of your summers,

84
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,090
but you're in the real world now.

85
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,612
- <i>Don't say it.</i>
- I still think I was right.

86
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,763
<i>Once every 6.3 seconds,</i>
<i>a man says something stupid</i>

87
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,763
<i>that another man hears and punishes</i>
<i>him for. Luckily, this wasn't...</i>

88
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,012
- That's it!
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

89
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,660
Do you know what this is?
This is me washing my hands of you.

90
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,493
I will not be in the same room
with you again, starting...

91
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,563
now.

92
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,152
Tissue?

93
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,615
<i>It's a challenge...</i>

94
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,633
<i>Little bit of flow, like...</i>

95
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,597
<i>''Fighting Joe'' Hooker...</i>

96
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,722
<i>I don't need Dr Cox. Big jerk.</i>

97
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,925
<i>I hate him.</i>

98
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,799
Hey, sport.
Or should I say howdy, Mr Pouty?

99
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,706
It's been a rough day.

100
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,696
So I hear. Well, anyway,
I'm very proud of you, Dr...

101
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,982
<i>Just look at my badge.</i>

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,479
Dr Turk.

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,976
This is my roommate's badge.
We must have switched...

104
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:59,280
That's a great anecdote. You should
write that down in your journal.

105
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,536
Then your kids can read about it
when you're dead.

106
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,826
- They're waiting for us...
- In a moment.

107
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:09,923
If you go easy on the stories, I'd love
you to join me for golf tomorrow.

108
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,941
- That'd be terrific, sir.
- Super.

109
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,152
You wanna show a woman you know her,
buy her a little something.

110
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,045
None of my patients are improving.

111
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,200
- I'm gonna buy her flowers.
- Yeah!

112
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,880
Please, been done to death.

113
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,278
I don't get it.
I do everything by the book.

114
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,176
Maybe that's the problem.
You approach things too clinically.

115
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,652
How about chocolates?

116
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,116
With rich cliché centres?

117
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,770
Have you ever treated your patients

118
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,486
with something other
than traditional medicine?

119
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,797
I'm gonna buy her a really nice pen.

120
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,376
No, she loves to write.
She handwrites all of her letters

121
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,282
because she says e-mail's
too impersonal. That's perfect.

122
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,561
- A pen is good.
- Yeah!

123
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,877
All I gotta do is find time to get
out of here and maybe I'll buy her one.

124
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,602
All I'm saying is there's more
to healing than what's in the books.

125
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:27,827
I talk to my patients. I sing
to them, ask what their hobbies are,

126
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,489
and tell them ghost stories
about an old sea captain.

127
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,544
Thought you'd be interested
in that kid Jared's chart.

128
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,765
Look at that white blood cell count.

129
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,693
And all it took
was a visit from The Rock.

130
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,176
The Rock was here
and nobody told me?

131
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,719
- The Rock couldn't make it.
- Well, somebody did something.

132
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,986
<i>It felt weird knowing Dr Cox and I would</i>
<i>never be working in the same room again.</i>

133
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,809
Check her LFTs and coags.

134
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,759
<i>Every time I think something,</i>
<i>the opposite happens.</i>

135
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,920
<i>I'm not having sex this weekend.</i>

136
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,809
You're cute.

137
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,934
Who's the present from?

138
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,294
- My boyfriend.
- When did he give it to you?

139
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:23,147
<i>He's pretending yesterday didn't happen.</i>
<i>If he thinks I'll forgive him...</i>

140
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,077
The reason I was
bent out of shape yesterday...

141
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,743
- I accept!
- Don't interrupt me. Come here.

142
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,557
Pull that curtain.

143
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,119
Mrs Blitt over there needs
the TIPS procedure, no insurance.

144
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,485
She can now look forward
to a lifetime

145
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,736
of encephalopathy and jaundice
thanks to Bottom-Line Bob.

146
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,630
- Is he really that bad?
- I hate Robert Kelso.

147
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,918
I hate his family, friends, the guy
that cleans his racist lawn jockey.

148
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,611
I hate anybody who even associates
with him. Is that clear?

149
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,383
Totally.

150
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,875
Call me.

151
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,737
Elliot, check out these ass slides.

152
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,015
How's that stuff even get up there?

153
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,554
I fell on it.

154
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,017
I fell on it.

155
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,386
I fell on it.

156
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,002
I was bored.

157
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,082
The doctors in the ER have a box
where they keep all this junk.

158
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:29,327
- Next to the Lost and Found Box?
- There's no Lost and Found Box.

159
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,860
There's an Ass Box.

160
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,364
- That's not Carla's pen?
- I had no time to shop!

161
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,233
Beautiful day for golf, sports?

162
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,432
Yes, sir, Dr Kelso.

163
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:56,673
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I am not a guy you wanna mess with.

164
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,860
Steadman, I need a tee.

165
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,912
A tee, or some tea, sir?
Because I've brought both.

166
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,954
<i>It's just a friendly game of golf</i>
<i>with a couple of guys from work.</i>

167
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,917
Excellent, our fourth has arrived.

168
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,320
What's up, Newbie?

169
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,281
<i>He's got nothing to say.</i>
<i>After all, he's here too.</i>

170
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,481
- I thought you hated Kelso.
- I do.

171
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,491
And watching his face
as I kick his worthless butt

172
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,769
up and down this golf course every week,
is basically...

173
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,788
It's the most fun I can have
without having to cuddle afterwards.

174
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,311
Good night, Irene!
Fantastic golf shot, sir.

175
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,739
Real nice length.
Now, does your husband happen to play?

176
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,216
But, no,
I'm not a hypocrite for being here.

177
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:00,862
What's your pathetic excuse,
you whiny little suck-up?

178
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,847
<i>Ignore him.</i>
<i>Just let your game do all the talking.</i>

179
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,140
That'll play.

180
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,567
Don't open it!
Please, don't open it!

181
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:27,104
Since we've been chatting, maybe you
could raise your heart rate for me?

182
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,724
What am I doing? This is stupid.

183
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,351
Don't make her open it.

184
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,291
Are you that busy?

185
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,238
You do know me.
Sweetie, I love this!

186
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,087
It's so, it's so cool. It's cool.

187
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,728
- I'm woozy.
- You're fine.

188
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,319
Today's the day I finally beat
his uppity, insubordinate...

189
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,302
Great shot, doctor!

190
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,821
You see, I always say
keep your friends close

191
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,047
and your enemies closer.

192
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,594
Can you believe him?
You're away and yet he hit first.

193
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,453
- It's a technicality.
- But there's the rub.

194
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,686
The rules are there for a reason.

195
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,579
If you break one,
why not break them all?

196
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,845
Before medicine ever became a business,

197
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,481
the only rule
was to do your best to help the patient.

198
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,184
Like it or not,
medicine is a business.

199
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,616
If the hospital shuts down,
then who are we helping then?

200
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,454
So, only people with money
deserve medical treatment?

201
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,411
Dammit!

202
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,838
It's about what's best for the hospital.

203
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,995
It's about what's best for the patient.

204
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,734
The only reason I go back
to that hospital day after day

205
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,029
is because I care
about those patients.

206
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,243
Every one of 'em.

207
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,225
You've got a lot of potential, sport.

208
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,735
You stick with me

209
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,524
and you're going to be climbing
the ladder very quickly.

210
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,916
Isn't that what you want?

211
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,117
You have to sink this
for the win, Cox.

212
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,305
Newbie, I almost forgot.

213
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,714
I'm gonna get Mrs Blitt
her TIPS procedure tomorrow,

214
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,062
with or without insurance,
and I want you to help me.

215
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:13,835
Now tell me, do you have the stones
to sink a putt when you have to?

216
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,174
See you next Wednesday.

217
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,129
I love this game.

218
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,136
I can't decide if I should help Cox.

219
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,546
At least you didn't give your girlfriend
a gift that used to be inside someone.

220
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,802
That's true.

221
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,596
I have magic breasts.

222
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,351
How many has she had?

223
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,153
Almost one.

224
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,519
You know what,
Cox doesn't need your help

225
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,774
taking her down
for a TIPS procedure.

226
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:58,034
He shouldn't even be
putting you in that situation.

227
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,810
- You're right.
- Hell, yeah, I'm right!

228
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,994
Screw Cox.

229
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,432
- Not afraid of him, are you?
- Hell, no!

230
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,709
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

231
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,206
- That's four.
- That's three.

232
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,825
That's five.

233
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,623
All righty, we're through here.

234
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,011
- Somebody call it.
- Wait.

235
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,520
Right. Time of death, 6.20.

236
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,903
Hey. There's my buppy.

237
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,321
Did you just say ''buppy''?

238
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,097
Cos that's not gonna work for me.

239
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,775
Carla, we gotta talk.

240
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,127
We can talk later.

241
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,821
Later's good.

242
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,488
Let's just worry about
getting you better. OK, gorgeous?

243
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,597
<i>I decided Cox was wrong.</i>

244
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,734
<i>There's room to play by the rules</i>
<i>and care about the patients.</i>

245
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,026
Do a wallet biopsy on her, and
if the insurance doesn't check out,

246
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:17,834
I want her in the nursing home before
she can gum down a single fruit cup.

247
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,875
<i>That was when I realised</i>
<i>how Dr Kelso truly saw these people.</i>

248
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,332
<i>Could I have a price check</i>
<i>on a 74-year-old female</i>

249
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,539
<i>with prerenal azotemia?</i>

250
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,708
Bag her.

251
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,261
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

252
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,426
Wait. It's about the pen.

253
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,824
I thought a really nice one
would be a great gift,

254
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:50,176
and I see a great one...
in the Lost and Found Box.

255
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,074
There is no Lost and Found Box.
There's an Ass Box...

256
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,360
Yeah, there is.

257
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,268
And you were this close
to getting everything you wanted.

258
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,652
I assume this is what you wanted.

259
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,157
Yes.

260
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,608
And yet you tell me
that your thoughtful token of love

261
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,801
wasn't a token of love at all.
It was an ass pen.

262
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:21,177
You come home and tell me this
because being open and honest

263
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,507
is more important to you
than having sex with me?

264
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,346
Are you coming or what?

265
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,511
Hell, yeah.

266
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,827
Stay, Rowdy, stay.

267
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,148
It took me three hours to realise...

268
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,404
- Excuse me, miss.
- Can I help you?

269
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,703
I'm afraid I have an awful case
of the gotta-see-'ems.

270
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,458
That's not even a real disease.

271
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,945
At what point
did I become a crazy person?

272
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,857
Come on.
Yes, exposing yourself to a dead guy

273
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,049
might have been a tad unorthodox,

274
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,536
and it might be hard to live down.

275
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,189
- I'm waiting for the ''but''.
- So's everyone else.

276
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,913
That's not funny.

277
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,141
- Thanks. Glad I shared.
- Come on.

278
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,719
When I look at you, I look at a doctor

279
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,468
who will do whatever it takes
to help a patient.

280
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,379
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

281
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,414
<i>And on that note...</i>

282
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,617
If you still want my help,
I'm on board.

283
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,511
It's way too big of a risk for a peon.

284
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,544
I just wanted to see
what team you were playing for.

285
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,065
- <i>So it was all a test.</i>
- Besides,

286
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,574
- I already did it.
- Cox!

287
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,114
Run, Junior. Daddy's home.

288
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,869
Did you think
I wouldn't find out what you did?

289
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,015
- What did I do?
- You insolent...

290
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,304
I'm insolent?

291
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,399
<i>I know it sounds melodramatic,</i>
<i>but as I watched the two of them,</i>

292
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:59,568
<i>they weren't battling for patients</i>
<i>or insurance, but for my soul.</i>

293
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,426
- She needed the TIPS...
- I've got you this time.

294
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,257
I can taste it!

295
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:09,362
<i>It's an old story, really.</i>
<i>Good versus bad. Right versus wrong.</i>

296
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,262
<i>The dark side versus the light.</i>

297
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,071
I've been waiting
for this moment all my life.

298
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,562
Easy, Chewie.

299
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,445
I'll teach you
to respect this institution.

300
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,581
I hope you learn from this.

301
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,611
No!

302
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:55,336
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.

303
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:07,215
Well, sport. It looks like
a permanent spot just opened up

304
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,348
on the golf course.

305
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,989
How does joining the Chief of Medicine
for a weekly round sound?

306
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,302
I'm not really that into golf.

307
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:20,194
I guess that's your choice,
isn't it, Dr Dorian?

308
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,546
<i>I liked it better</i>
<i>when he didn't know my name.</i>

309
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,118
That's one for me.

310
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,117
That's two.

311
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,529
I'm hurt.

312
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
